The DNA structure of the cell is made up of two helixes made up of sugar and phosphate held together by hydrogen bonds between the bases of opposite strands . The sugar and the phosphate in each strand are joined together by stronger phosphodiester covalent bonds . The DNA is `` unzipped '' ( disruption of hydrogen bonds between different single strands ) by the enzyme helicase , leaving the single nucleotide chain open to be copied . RNA polymerase reads the DNA strand from the 3 - prime ( 3 ' ) end to the 5 - prime ( 5 ' ) end , while it synthesizes a single strand of messenger RNA in the 5 ' - to - 3 ' direction . The general RNA structure is very similar to the DNA structure , but in RNA the nucleotide uracil takes the place that thymine occupies in DNA . The single strand of mRNA leaves the nucleus through nuclear pores , and migrates into the cytoplasm . \n             Question: where is the protien made in the cell ? \n             Answer: ",

This electron is passed to a modified form of chlorophyll called pheophytin , which passes the electron to a quinone molecule , starting the flow of electrons down an electron transport chain that leads to the ultimate reduction of NADP to NADPH . In addition , this creates a proton gradient ( energy gradient ) across the chloroplast membrane , which is used by ATP synthase in the synthesis of ATP . The chlorophyll molecule ultimately regains the electron it lost when a water molecule is split in a process called photolysis , which releases a dioxygen ( O ) molecule as a waste product . \n             Question: what is the first basic process in the light reaction of photosynthesis ? \n             Answer: ",

Each second , more than four million tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the Sun 's core , producing neutrinos and solar radiation . At this rate , the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy , about 0.03 % of the total mass of the Sun . The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main - sequence star . The Sun is gradually becoming hotter during its time on the main sequence , because the helium atoms in the core occupy less volume than the hydrogen atoms that were fused . The core is therefore shrinking , allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the centre and experience a stronger gravitational force , according to the inverse - square law . This stronger force increases the pressure on the core , which is resisted by a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs . This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser . It is estimated that the Sun has become 30 % brighter in the last 4.5 billion years .

On June 11 , 1776 , Congress appointed a `` Committee of Five '' to draft a declaration , consisting of John Adams of Massachusetts , Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania , Thomas Jefferson of Virginia , Robert R. Livingston of New York , and Roger Sherman of Connecticut . The committee left no minutes , so there is some uncertainty about how the drafting process proceeded ; contradictory accounts were written many years later by Jefferson and Adams , too many years to be regarded as entirely reliable -- although their accounts are frequently cited . What is certain is that the committee discussed the general outline which the document should follow and decided that Jefferson would write the first draft . The committee in general , and Jefferson in particular , thought that Adams should write the document , but Adams persuaded the committee to choose Jefferson and promised to consult with him personally . Considering Congress 's busy schedule , Jefferson probably had limited time for writing over the next seventeen days , and likely wrote the draft quickly . He then consulted the others and made some changes , and then produced another copy incorporating these alterations . The committee presented this copy to the Congress on June 28 , 1776 . The title of the document was `` A Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of America , in General Congress assembled .

It can also be used to acknowledge the impossibility of a situation , in the same way that `` pigs might fly '' is used . An example is if one says : `` I may agree that if two plus two equals five , then I am a monkey 's uncle '' . `` I 'll be a monkey 's uncle '' has been said to date from after 1925 , the date of the widely publicized Scopes Trial in the United States , where the term first appears . The Oxford English Dictionary 's earliest example is the phrase If that 's a joke I 'm a monkey 's uncle , from an Ohio newspaper on 8 February 1925 . It was originally a sarcastic remark made by creationists . The notion `` that ( people ) were descended from apes was considered blasphemous ... by Darwin 's contemporaries '' , and it was for this reason that the sarcastic phrase came into use . \n             Question: where did the saying monkey's uncle come from ? \n             Answer: ",

The need to limit body weight in order , for example , to fly , has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species , such as bats . Most of the brain 's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge ( membrane potential ) of neurons . Most vertebrate species devote between 2 % and 8 % of basal metabolism to the brain . In primates , however , the percentage is much higher -- in humans it rises to 20 -- 25 % . The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time , but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions ; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET , fMRI , and NIRS . The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen - dependent metabolism of glucose ( i.e. , blood sugar ) , but ketones provide a major alternative source , together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids ( caprylic and heptanoic acids ) , lactate , acetate , and possibly amino acids . \n             Question: where does the brain get its energy from ? \n             Answer: ",

South Dakota and Wyoming were the final two states to comply with the age 21 mandate . The current drinking age of 21 remains a point of contention among many Americans , because of it being higher than the age of majority ( 18 in most states ) and higher than the drinking ages of most other countries .

His army group was created specifically to wage war against the Serbian army in the pre-1913 borders of the country ( `` Old Serbia '' ) , to defeat it wherever it found it and to open the land route between Hungary and Bulgaria . As commander , Mackensen acted independently and received his directives only from the German High Command . However , the field marshal 's orders to his Bulgarian forces had to be relayed to the commander of the 1st Army by the Bulgarian General Staff , which left room for the latter to intervene when needed . According to the convention , the Bulgarian commander - in - chief retained full and direct control over the Bulgarian 2nd Army and its operations in Vardar Macedonia . \n             Question: who did the central powers defeat on the eastern front before concentrating back on france ? \n             Answer: ",

For a time he led Hut 8 , the section which was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis . Here he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers , including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method , an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine . Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements , including the Battle of the Atlantic , and in so doing helped win the war . Counterfactual history is difficult with respect to the effect Ultra intelligence had on the length of the war , but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over fourteen million lives . \n             Question: who cracked the enigma code in world war 2 ? \n             Answer: ",

It may be used to alleviate symptoms such as muscle spasms , pain , and hyperreflexia . The term `` muscle relaxant '' is used to refer to two major therapeutic groups : neuromuscular blockers and spasmolytics . Neuromuscular blockers act by interfering with transmission at the neuromuscular end plate and have no central nervous system ( CNS ) activity . They are often used during surgical procedures and in intensive care and emergency medicine to cause temporary paralysis . Spasmolytics , also known as `` centrally acting '' muscle relaxants , are used to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms and to reduce spasticity in a variety of neurological conditions .

A move toward sustainable living by increasing public awareness and adoption of recycling , and renewable energies emerged . The development of renewable sources of energy in the 1970s and ' 80s , primarily in wind turbines and photovoltaics and increased use of hydroelectricity , presented some of the first sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel and nuclear energy generation , the first large - scale solar and wind power plants appearing during the 1980s and ' 90s .

The western coast of Australia had been discovered for Europeans by the Dutch explorer Willem Janszoon in 1606 and was later named New Holland by the Dutch East India Company , but there was no attempt to colonise it . In 1770 James Cook discovered the eastern coast of Australia while on a scientific voyage to the South Pacific Ocean , claimed the continent for Britain , and named it New South Wales . In 1778 , Joseph Banks , Cook 's botanist on the voyage , presented evidence to the government on the suitability of Botany Bay for the establishment of a penal settlement , and in 1787 the first shipment of convicts set sail , arriving in 1788 . Britain continued to transport convicts to New South Wales until 1840 .

The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands . The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states : sympathetic and parasympathetic . \n             Question: explain the function of the peripheral nervous system ? \n             Answer: ",

Famous early Romantic composers include Beethoven ( whose works span both this period and the preceding Classical period ) , Schubert , Schumann , Chopin , Mendelssohn , Bellini , and Berlioz . The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra and in the dynamic range and diversity of instruments used in this ensemble . Also , public concerts became a key part of urban middle class society , in contrast to earlier periods , when concerts were mainly paid for by and performed for aristocrats . Famous composers from the second half of the century include Bruckner , Johann Strauss II , Brahms , Liszt , Tchaikovsky , Dvo\u0159\u00e1k , Verdi , and Wagner . Between 1890 and 1910 , a third wave of composers including Mahler , Richard Strauss , Puccini , and Sibelius built on the work of middle Romantic composers to create even more complex -- and often much longer -- musical works . A prominent mark of late 19th century music is its nationalistic fervor , as exemplified by such figures as Dvo\u0159\u00e1k , Sibelius , and Grieg .

For instance , there are two types of tin oxide : one is 88.1 % tin and 11.9 % oxygen and the other is 78.7 % tin and 21.3 % oxygen ( tin ( II ) oxide and tin dioxide respectively ) . This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5 g or 27g of oxygen . 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1 : 2 , a ratio of small whole numbers . This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in whole number multiples of discrete units -- in other words , atoms .

Eyespots can only sense ambient brightness : they can distinguish light from dark , sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms . They are insufficient for vision , as they can not distinguish shapes or determine the direction light is coming from . Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups , and are common among unicellular organisms , including euglena . The euglena 's eyespot , called a stigma , is located at its anterior end . It is a small splotch of red pigment which shades a collection of light sensitive crystals . Together with the leading flagellum , the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light , often toward the light to assist in photosynthesis , and to predict day and night , the primary function of circadian rhythms . Visual pigments are located in the brains of more complex organisms , and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles . By detecting the subtle changes in night - time illumination , organisms could synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the probability of fertilisation . \n             Question: what is the first step in the evolution of the eye ? \n             Answer: ",

In 835 , Louis the Pious switched it to 1 November in the Carolingian Empire , at the behest of Pope Gregory IV . However , from the testimony of Pseudo-Bede , it is known that churches in what are now England and Germany were already celebrating All Saints on 1 November at the beginning of the 8th century . Thus , Louis merely made official the custom of celebrating it on 1 November . James Frazer suggests that 1 November was chosen because it was the date of the Celtic festival of the dead ( Samhain ) -- the Celts had influenced their English neighbours , and English missionaries had influenced the Germans . However , Ronald Hutton points out that , according to \u00d3engus of Tallaght ( d . ca . 824 ) , the 7th / 8th century church in Ireland celebrated All Saints on 20 April . He suggests that the 1 November date was a Germanic rather than a Celtic idea . In the 11th century , 2 November became established as All Souls ' Day . This created the three - day observance known as Allhallowtide : All Hallows ' Eve ( 31 October ) , All Hallows ' Day ( 1 November ) , and All Souls ' Day ( 2 November ) . \n             Question: the christian church used which holiday to take attention away from samhain ? \n             Answer: ",

They were the first architectural expression the new empire made in the Indian sub-continent , and fulfilled diverse functions with strong symbolic meanings . The symbolism of these gardens is derived from mystic Islamic texts describing paradise as a garden filled with abundant trees , flowers and plants , with water playing a key role : In Paradise four rivers source at a central spring or mountain . In their ideal form they were laid out as a square subdivided into four equal parts . These rivers are often represented in the charbagh as shallow canals which separate the garden by flowing towards the cardinal points . The canals represent the promise of water , milk , wine and honey . The centre of the garden , at the intersection of the divisions is highly symbolically charged and is where , in the ideal form , a pavilion , pool or tomb would be situated . The tombs of Humayun , Akbar and Jahangir , the previous Mughal emperors , follow this pattern . The cross axial garden also finds independent precedents within South Asia dating from the 5th century where the royal gardens of Sigiriya in Sri Lanka were laid out in a similar way . \n             Question: the taj mahal served as an example of aesthetic value for this kind of function ? \n             Answer: ",

Its major provision was enforcing racially separated educational facilities . Even universities were made `` tribal '' , and all but three missionary schools chose to close down when the government no longer would help support their schools . Very few authorities continued using their own finances to support education for native Africans . In 1959 , this type of education was extended to `` non white '' universities and colleges with the Extension of University Education Act , and the internationally prestigious University College of Fort Hare was taken over by the government and degraded to being part of the Bantu education system . It is often argued that the policy of Bantu ( African ) education was aimed to direct black or non-white youth to the unskilled labour market , although Hendrik Verwoerd , at the time Minister of Native Affairs , claimed that the aim was to solve South Africa 's `` ethnic problems '' by creating complementary economic and political units for different ethnic groups . \n             Question: what was the purpose of the bantu education act ? \n             Answer: ",

Condensers use relatively cool water , via various means , to condense the steam coming out of the cylinders or turbines . This reduces the back pressure , which in turn reduces the steam consumption , and thus the fuel consumption , while at the same time increasing power and recycling boiler - water . However the condensers require an ample supply of cooling water , without which they are impractical . The consumption of cooling water by inland processing and power plants is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power plants by 2040 -- 2069 .

However , due to the dual carboxylase and oxygenase activity of RuBisCo , some part of the substrate is oxidized rather than carboxylated , resulting in loss of substrate and consumption of energy , in what is known as photorespiration . In order to bypass the photorespiration pathway , C plants have developed a mechanism to efficiently deliver CO to the RuBisCO enzyme . They utilize their specific leaf anatomy where chloroplasts exist not only in the mesophyll cells in the outer part of their leaves but in the bundle sheath cells as well . Instead of direct fixation to RuBisCO in the Calvin cycle , CO is incorporated into a 4 - carbon organic acid , which has the ability to regenerate CO in the chloroplasts of the bundle sheath cells .

A first - class Canadian passenger , Mrs. Vera Dick , and several other passengers , alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' . Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship , `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' would be one of the songs he would play . But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection . \n             Question: what song did the titanic band play when it sank ? \n             Answer: ",

Others assert that the idea was probably derived from the tent , which remains in an unaltered form to the present day . However , the tradition existing in China is that it originated in standards and banners waving in the air , hence the use of the umbrella was often linked to high - ranking ( though not necessarily royalty ) in China . On at least one occasion , twenty - four umbrellas were carried before the Emperor when he went out hunting . The umbrella served in this case as a defense against rain rather than sun .

In the 1960s , the past record of geomagnetic reversals was noticed by observing the magnetic stripe `` anomalies '' on the ocean floor . This results in broadly evident `` stripes '' from which the past magnetic field polarity can be inferred by looking at the data gathered from simply towing a magnetometer on the sea surface or from an aircraft . The stripes on one side of the mid-ocean ridge were the mirror image of those on the other side .

A rift between Eastwood and Kaufman developed during the filming . Kaufman insisted on filming with a meticulous attention to detail , which caused disagreements with Eastwood , not to mention the attraction the two shared towards Locke and apparent jealousy on Kaufman 's part in regards to their emerging relationship . One evening , Kaufman insisted on finding a beer can as a prop to be used in a scene , but while he was absent , Eastwood ordered Surtees to quickly shoot the scene as light was fading and then drove away , leaving before Kaufman had returned . Soon after , filming moved to Kanab , Utah . On October 24 , 1975 , Kaufman was fired at Eastwood 's command by producer Bob Daley . The sacking caused an outrage amongst the Directors Guild of America and other important Hollywood executives , since the director had already worked hard on the film , including completing all of the pre-production .

Some members of the Women 's Social and Political Union ( WSPU , commonly referred to as suffragettes ) had been imprisoned for acts of vandalism in support of women 's suffrage . In protest to being imprisoned some of these suffragettes undertook hunger strikes . These suffragettes were then force - fed leading to a public outcry . This act was a response to the outcry ; it allowed the prisoners to be released on licence as soon as the hunger strike affected their health . They then had a period of time in which they could recover . After a predetermined period of time the prisoner would be rearrested to serve out the rest of their sentence . Conditions could be placed on the prisoner during the time of their release . The hunger strikes themselves were now technically legal . However , the Act allowed for the re-imprisonment of the hunger strikers upon their recovery on their original charges . The nickname of the Act came about because of a cat 's habit of playing with its prey ( a mouse ) before finishing it off . \n             Question: when was the cat and mouse act introduced ? \n             Answer: ",

By forcing the bullet to spin as it travels down the barrel of the weapon the bullet 's accuracy greatly increases . At the same time , the rifling leaves marks on the bullet that are indicative of that particular barrel . Prior to mass production of firearms , each barrel and bullet mold was hand made by gunsmiths making them unique . The first successful documented case of forensic firearm examination occurred in 1835 when a member of the Bow Street Runners in London matched a recovered bullet from a murder victim to a specific mold in a suspect 's home confirming that he made the bullet . Further evidence that the bullet maker was the perpetrator was found in his home and he was convicted . As manufacturing and automation replaced hand tools , the ability to compare bullets became impossible due to the standardization of molds within a specific company . However , experts in the field postulated that there were microscopic differences on each barrel left during the manufacturing process . These differences were a result of wear on the machines and since each new weapon caused a tiny amount of wear , each barrel would be slightly different from every other barrel produced by that company . Also , each bullet fired from a specific barrel would be printed with the same marks , allowing investigators to identify the weapon that fired a specific bullet . \n             Question: when was the first documented case of tool mark identification ? \n             Answer: ",

The epidermis can be further subdivided into the following strata ( beginning with the outermost layer ) : corneum , lucidum ( only in palms of hands and bottoms of feet ) , granulosum , spinosum , basale .

The daughter cells ( see cell division ) move up the strata changing shape and composition as they die due to isolation from their blood source . The cytoplasm is released and the protein keratin is inserted . They eventually reach the corneum and slough off ( desquamation ) . This process is called `` keratinization '' .

However , Warhaftig later denied this , stating that a space had been left for him ( as he was one of the signatories trapped in Jerusalem ) where a Hebraicised form of his name would have fitted alphabetically , but he insisted on signing under his actual name so as to honour his father 's memory and so moved down two spaces .

It was started with the building of local isolated wooden wagonways starting in 1560s . The system was later built as a patchwork of local rail links operated by small private railway companies in late 18th century . These isolated links developed during the railway boom of the 1840s into a national network , although still run by dozens of competing companies . Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries , these amalgamated or were bought by competitors until only a handful of larger companies remained ( see railway mania ) . The entire network was brought under government control during the First World War and a number of advantages of amalgamation and planning were revealed . However , the government resisted calls for the nationalisation of the network . In 1923 , almost all the remaining companies were grouped into the `` big four '' , the Great Western Railway , the London and North Eastern Railway , the London , Midland and Scottish Railway and the Southern Railway .

The drought came in three waves , 1934 , 1936 , and 1939 -- 1940 , but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years . With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains , farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade ; this had displaced the native , deep - rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds .
