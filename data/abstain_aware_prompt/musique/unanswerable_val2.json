The motivation for the reform was to bring the date for the celebration of Easter to the time of the year in which it was celebrated when it was introduced by the early Church. Because the celebration of Easter was tied to the spring equinox, the Roman Catholic Church considered the steady drift in the date of Easter caused by the year being slightly too long to be undesirable. The reform was adopted initially by the Catholic countries of Europe. Protestants and Eastern Orthodox countries continued to use the traditional Julian calendar and adopted the Gregorian reform after a time, for the sake of convenience in international trade. The last European country to adopt the reform was Greece, in 1923. \n             Question: How long does the biggest celebration last in the country where Eagle Beach is located? \n             Answer: ",

After the 1994 FIFA World Cup a plate was added to the bottom side of the trophy on which the names of winning countries are engraved, names therefore not visible when the trophy is standing upright.

In 2010, however, the name of the winning nation was engraved as`` 2010 Spain'', in English, not in Spanish. As of 2018, twelve winners have been engraved on the base. The plate is replaced each World Cup cycle and the names of the trophy winners are rearranged into a spiral to accommodate future winners, with Spain on later occasions written in Spanish (``Espa\u00f1a '').

Current from the brushes flows through the commutator and one winding of the armature, making it a temporary magnet (an electromagnet). The magnetic field produced by the armature interacts with a stationary magnetic field produced by either PMs or another winding a field coil, as part of the motor frame. The force between the two magnetic fields tends to rotate the motor shaft. The commutator switches power to the coils as the rotor turns, keeping the magnetic poles of the rotor from ever fully aligning with the magnetic poles of the stator field, so that the rotor never stops (like a compass needle does), but rather keeps rotating as long as power is applied.\n Paragraph 2: Way to Go is a British television sitcom, created by American television writer and producer Bob Kushell, about three men who start an assisted suicide business.

Much of the impetus for lowering the drinking age to 18 was to grant returning Vietnam veterans the right to purchase alcohol. Possibly because of concerns about 18 - year - old high school students being able to legally purchase liquor, and then illegally consume it school, the state raised the drinking age to 19 in 1980. Citing statistics that indicated an increase in car deaths among drivers under 21, the drinking age was raised back to 21 in 1983. At the same time, the penalties for underage drinking were increased to include a mandatory driver's license suspension. In 1985, the state made it illegal for an adult to give alcohol to a person under 21, with exception for religious services and parents serving alcohol to their own children at home or in a private area.\n Paragraph 4: The drinking age in Wisconsin is 21.

The mean income is usually more affected by the relatively unequal distribution of income which tilts towards the top.

Overall, the mean household income in the United States, according to the US Census Bureau 2014 Annual Social and Economic Supplement, was $72,641. \n             Question: What's the average income in the region containing Lairds Landing? \n             Answer: ",

During this period he investigated the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured spectrum produced by a prism could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism. Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to corpuscular alchemy.He showed that coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour.\n Paragraph 2: Newcastle United 2016 -- 17 season Owner Mike Ashley Managing director Lee Charnley Manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez Stadium St James' Park Championship 1st (Champions, Promoted) EFL Cup Fifth round (knocked out by Hull City) FA Cup Fourth Round (knocked out by Oxford United) Top goalscorer League: Dwight Gayle (23) All: Dwight Gayle (23) Home colours Away colours Third colours \u2190 2015 -- 16 2017 -- 18 \u2192\n Paragraph 3: The 2017 -- 18 UEFA Champions League knockout phase will begin on 13 February and end on 26 May 2018 with the final at the NSC Olimpiyskiy Stadium in Kiev, Ukraine, to decide the champions of the 2017 -- 18 UEFA Champions League.

The musicologist Daniel E. Freeman has recently demonstrated that it was composed with close reference to the opera \"La Nitteti\" by Josef Myslive\u010dek. The latter was the opera being prepared for production in Bologna when Mozart met Myslive\u010dek for the first time with his father in March 1770. Myslive\u010dek visited the Mozarts frequently in Bologna during the summer of 1770 while Wolfgang was working on \"Mitridate\". Mozart gained expertise in composition from his older friend and also incorporated some of his musical motives into his own operatic setting. The opera was first performed at the Teatro Regio Ducal, Milan, on 26 December 1770 (at the Milan Carnival). It was a success, having been performed twenty-one times despite doubts because of Mozart's extreme youth \u2013 he was 14 at the time. No revival took place until the 20th century. This opera features virtuoso arias for the principal roles, but only two ensemble numbers: the act 2 ending duet between Aspasia and Sifare (\"Se viver non degg\u2019io\"), and the brief quintet that ends the opera, very characteristic of standard baroque opera seria where the opera ends with a short \"coro\" or \"tutti\" number. \n             Question: Who is the main subject in Biographies of the composer of Mitridate, re di Ponto? \n             Answer: ",

However, they were alarmed by the Greek Cypriot calls for enosis as they saw the union of Crete with Greece, which led to the exodus of Cretan Turks, as a precedent to be avoided, and they took a pro-partition stance in response to the militant activity of EOKA. The Turkish Cypriots also viewed themselves as a distinct ethnic group of the island and believed in their having a separate right to self-determination from Greek Cypriots. Meanwhile, in the 1950s, Turkish leader Menderes considered Cyprus an \"extension of Anatolia\", rejected the partition of Cyprus along ethnic lines and favoured the annexation of the whole island to Turkey. Nationalistic slogans centred on the idea that \"Cyprus is Turkish\" and the ruling party declared Cyprus to be a part of the Turkish homeland that was vital to its security. Upon realising the fact that the Turkish Cypriot population was only 20% of the islanders made annexation unfeasible, the national policy was changed to favour partition. The slogan \"Partition or Death\" was frequently used in Turkish Cypriot and Turkish protests starting in the late 1950s and continuing throughout the 1960s. Although after the Z\u00fcrich and London conferences Turkey seemed to accept the existence of the Cypriot state and to distance itself from its policy of favouring the partition of the island, the goal of the Turkish and Turkish Cypriot leaders remained that of creating an independent Turkish state in the northern part of the island.\n Paragraph 2: Abdallah Mohamed Kamil (\u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0643\u0627\u0645\u0644) (born 1936, in Obock) is a Djiboutian politician.

Prior to the unification of China by the First Emperor in 221 BC, Beijing had been for centuries the capital of the ancient states of Ji and Yan. During the first millennia of imperial rule, Beijing was a provincial city in northern China. Its stature grew in the 10th to the 13th centuries when the nomadic Khitan and forest - dwelling Jurchen peoples from beyond the Great Wall expanded southward and made the city a capital of their dynasties, the Liao and Jin. When Kublai Khan made Dadu the capital of the Mongol - led Yuan dynasty (1279 -- 1368), all of China was ruled from Beijing for the first time. From 1279 onward, with the exception of two interludes from 1368 to 1420 and 1928 to 1949, Beijing would remain as China's capital, serving as the seat of power for the Ming dynasty (1421 -- 1644), the Manchu - led Qing dynasty (1644 -- 1912), the early Republic of China (1912 -- 1928) and now the People's Republic of China (1949 -- present).\n Paragraph 2: With the chance to return to his hometown and join reigning champions Beijing Guoan, Wang Xiaolong would make the switch from Shandong to Beijing at the beginning of the 2010 league season with teammate Wu Hao in a package deal. \n             Question: Who made the birthplace of Wang Xiaolong his capitol? \n             Answer: ",
