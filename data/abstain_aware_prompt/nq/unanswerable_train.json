In the first part of the 18th Century , the British West Indies were Great Britain 's most important trading partner , so Parliament was attentive to their requests . However , rather than acceding to the demands to prohibit the colonies from trading with the non-British islands , Parliament passed the prohibitively high tax on the colonies on molasses imported from those islands . If actually collected , the tax would have effectively closed that source to New England and destroyed much of the rum industry . Instead , smuggling , bribery or intimidation of customs officials effectively nullified the law . \n             Question: where were the colonists smuggling sugar and molasses from ? \n             Answer: ",

The descriptive `` milky '' is derived from the appearance from Earth of the galaxy -- a band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that can not be individually distinguished by the naked eye . The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via lactea , from the Greek \u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03be\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 ( galax\u00edas k\u00fdklos , `` milky circle '' ) . From Earth , the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk - shaped structure is viewed from within . Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610 . Until the early 1920s , most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe . Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis , observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies . \n             Question: where is earth within the milky way galaxy ? \n             Answer: ",

In 1800 , Napoleon , then the First Consul of the French Republic , hoping to re-establish an empire in North America , regained ownership of Louisiana . However , France 's failure to put down the revolt in Saint - Domingue , coupled with the prospect of renewed warfare with the United Kingdom , prompted Napoleon to sell Louisiana to the United States to fund his military . The Americans originally sought to purchase only the port city of New Orleans and its adjacent coastal lands , but quickly accepted the bargain . The Louisiana Purchase occurred during the term of the third President of the United States , Thomas Jefferson . Before the purchase was finalized , the decision faced Federalist Party opposition ; they argued that it was unconstitutional to acquire any territory . Jefferson agreed that the U.S. Constitution did not contain explicit provisions for acquiring territory , but he asserted that his constitutional power to negotiate treaties was sufficient . \n             Question: how many states comprised the united states before the purchase ? \n             Answer: ",

These motions comprise the internal energy of a substance . More specifically , the thermodynamic temperature of any bulk quantity of matter is the measure of the average kinetic energy per classical ( i.e. , non-quantum ) degree of freedom of its constituent particles . `` Translational motions '' are almost always in the classical regime . Translational motions are ordinary , whole - body movements in three - dimensional space in which particles move about and exchange energy in collisions . Figure 1 below shows translational motion in gases ; Figure 4 below shows translational motion in solids . Thermodynamic temperature 's null point , absolute zero , is the temperature at which the particle constituents of matter are as close as possible to complete rest ; that is , they have minimal motion , retaining only quantum mechanical motion . Zero kinetic energy remains in a substance at absolute zero ( see Thermal energy at absolute zero , below ) . \n             Question: molecular motion is independent of temperature and is unaffected by a change in temperature ? \n             Answer: ",

The Mail on Sunday rated it as `` the most imaginative debut since Roald Dahl '' ; a view echoed by the Sunday Times ( `` comparisons to Dahl are , this time , justified '' ) , while The Guardian called it `` a richly textured novel given lift - off by an inventive wit '' and The Scotsman said it had `` all the makings of a classic '' . \n             Question: what is the first harry potter book called in england ? \n             Answer: ",

In the UK the Health and Safety Executive have issued guidance called HSG264 describing how surveys should be completed although other methods can be used if they can demonstrate they have met the regulations by other means . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency includes some but not all asbestos - contaminated facilities on the Superfund National Priorities list ( NPL ) .

Although the Yeoman Warders were once the Royal Bodyguard , by the 16th and 17th centuries their main duty had become to look after the prisoners . The Tower was often a safer place than other prisons in London such as the Fleet , where disease was rife . High - status prisoners could live in conditions comparable to those they might expect outside ; one such example was that while Walter Raleigh was held in the Tower his rooms were altered to accommodate his family , including his son who was born there in 1605 . Executions were usually carried out on Tower Hill rather than in the Tower of London itself , and 112 people were executed on the hill over 400 years . Before the 20th century , there had been seven executions within the castle on Tower Green ; as was the case with Lady Jane Grey , this was reserved for prisoners for whom public execution was considered dangerous . After Lady Jane Grey 's execution on 12 February 1554 , Queen Mary I imprisoned her sister Elizabeth , later Queen Elizabeth I , in the Tower under suspicion of causing rebellion as Sir Thomas Wyatt had led a revolt against Mary in Elizabeth 's name . \n             Question: where were prisoners kept in the tower of london ? \n             Answer: ",

She wanted to have a one - shot agreement between CBS and producer Martha Williamson , but ordered more episodes . Reese was widely seen as a key component of the show 's success . Already starring on Touched by an Angel was the lesser - known Irish actress Roma Downey , who played the role of case worker Tess 's angel / employee , Monica . In numerous interviews , there was an on - and off - screen chemistry between both Reese and Downey . The character of Tess was the angelic supervisor who sent the other angels out on missions to help people redeem their lives and show them God 's love , while at the same time , she was sassy and had a no - nonsense attitude . The show often featured a climactic monologue delivered by the angel Monica in which she reveals herself as an angel to a human with the words : `` I am an angel sent by God to tell you that He loves you . '' The character of Tess was portrayed by Reese as down - to - earth , experienced and direct .

Such marital and occupational instability found among emerging adults can be attributed to the strong sense of individualization found in cultures that allow for this stage of development ; in individualized cultures , traditional familial and institutional constraints have become less pronounced than in previous times or in unindustrialized / developing cultures , allowing for more personal freedom in life decisions .

This perception was created in the 1920s and later by those who remembered the Edwardian age with nostalgia , looking back to their childhoods across the abyss of the Great War . The Edwardian age was also seen as a mediocre period of pleasure between the great achievements of the preceding Victorian age and the catastrophe of the following war . Since 2000 historiographical assessments emphasise the great differences between the wealthy and the poor during this period and describe the age as heralding great changes in political and social life . Historian Lawrence James has argued that the leaders felt increasingly threatened by rival powers such as Germany , Russia , and the United States .

It is seen as an example of early feminist literature because two female characters are able to solve a mystery that the male characters can not . They are aided by their knowledge of women 's psychology . Glaspell originally wrote the story as a one - act play entitled Trifles for the Provincetown Players in 1916 . The story was adapted into an episode of the 1950s TV series Alfred Hitchcock Presents . The story was adapted into a 30 - minute film by Sally Heckel in 1980 .

Problems with the old standards increased financial reporting risk and led to inefficiencies that increased cost . FASAC then voiced its concerns due to the increase of financial reporting guidance from the old U.S. GAAP standards , and the FASB responded by launching a new project to codify the standards .

Up , charm , and top quarks ( collectively referred to as up - type quarks ) have a charge of + \u200b \u2044 e , while down , strange , and bottom quarks ( down - type quarks ) have \u2212 \u200b \u2044 e . Antiquarks have the opposite charge to their corresponding quarks ; up - type antiquarks have charges of \u2212 \u200b \u2044 e and down - type antiquarks have charges of + \u200b \u2044 e . Since the electric charge of a hadron is the sum of the charges of the constituent quarks , all hadrons have integer charges : the combination of three quarks ( baryons ) , three antiquarks ( antibaryons ) , or a quark and an antiquark ( mesons ) always results in integer charges . For example , the hadron constituents of atomic nuclei , neutrons and protons , have charges of 0 e and + 1 e respectively ; the neutron is composed of two down quarks and one up quark , and the proton of two up quarks and one down quark . \n             Question: an antibaryon composed of two anti up quarks and one anti down quark would have a charge of ? \n             Answer: ",
