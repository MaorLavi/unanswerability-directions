Consequently , some pesticides that work on the M form no longer work on the S form . Over 3,500 species of the Culicidae have already been described . They are generally divided into two subfamilies which in turn comprise some 43 genera . These figures are subject to continual change , as more species are discovered , and as DNA studies compel rearrangement of the taxonomy of the family . The two main subfamilies are the Anophelinae and Culicinae , with their genera as shown in the subsection below . The distinction is of great practical importance because the two subfamilies tend to differ in their significance as vectors of different classes of diseases . Roughly speaking , arboviral diseases such as yellow fever and dengue fever tend to be transmitted by Culicine species , not necessarily in the genus Culex . Some transmit various species of avian malaria , but it is not clear that they ever transmit any form of human malaria . Some species do however transmit various forms of filariasis , much as many Simuliidae do . \n             Question: how many different species of mosquitoes are there ? \n             Answer: ",

A set of five nitrogenous bases is used in the construction of nucleotides , which in turn build up the nucleic acids like DNA and RNA . These nitrogenous bases are adenine ( A ) , uracil ( U ) , guanine ( G ) , thymine ( T ) , and cytosine ( C ) . The nitrogenous bases form hydrogen bonds between opposing DNA strands to form the rungs of the `` twisted ladder '' or double helix of DNA or a biological catalyst that is found in the nucleotides . Adenine is always paired with thymine , and guanine is always paired with cytosine . These are known as base pairs . Uracil is only present in RNA , replacing thymine .

The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the pathogen , called an antigen , via the Fab 's variable region . Each tip of the `` Y '' of an antibody contains a paratope ( analogous to a lock ) that is specific for one particular epitope ( similarly analogous to a key ) on an antigen , allowing these two structures to bind together with precision . Using this binding mechanism , an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system , or can neutralize its target directly ( for example , by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival ) . Depending on the antigen , the binding may impede the biological process causing the disease or may activate macrophages to destroy the foreign substance . The ability of an antibody to communicate with the other components of the immune system is mediated via its Fc region ( located at the base of the `` Y '' ) , which contains a conserved glycosylation site involved in these interactions . The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system . \n             Question: what is the role of antibodies in the immune response ? \n             Answer: ",

It is the first stage of wound healing . This involves coagulation , blood changing from a liquid to a gel . Intact blood vessels are central to moderating blood 's tendency to form clots . The endothelial cells of intact vessels prevent blood clotting with a heparin - like molecule and thrombomodulin and prevent platelet aggregation with nitric oxide and prostacyclin . When endothelial injury occurs , the endothelial cells stop secretion of coagulation and aggregation inhibitors and instead secrete von Willebrand factor which initiate the maintenance of hemostasis after injury . Hemostasis has three major steps : 1 ) vasoconstriction , 2 ) temporary blockage of a break by a platelet plug , and 3 ) blood coagulation , or formation of a fibrin clot .

The seven states had previously formed the League of the Southwest in 1917 to promote development along the river . In 1921 , Congress authorized the states to enter into a compact for allocation of the river resources . The agreement was approved by Congress in 1922 , the same year it was signed . Colorado River Compact was signed by the delegates from the seven Colorado River Basin states : Wyoming , Colorado , Utah and New Mexico were designated Upper Basin states and California , Arizona and Nevada as the Lower Basin states . This compact determined that the water would be shared equally among the upper and lower basin states . Prior to the compact , the name of the river was standardized along its length . Previously the portion of the river upstream from its confluence with the Green River had been known locally as the `` Grand River '' . The change was opposed by many local residents in Utah and Colorado , and the new name was enforced locally by acts of the state legislatures in both states in the early 1920s . One of the major concerns both today and back in the 1920s was the expanding population , and this increased the demand for water , particularly in California .

A leap day compensates for this lag , realigning the calendar with the Earth 's position in the Solar System ; otherwise , seasons would occur earlier than intended in the calendar year . The Julian calendar used in Christendom until the 16th century added a leap day every four years ; but this rule adds too many days ( roughly 3 every 400 years ) , making the equinoxes and solstices shift gradually to earlier dates . By the 16th century the vernal equinox had drifted to March 11 , and the Gregorian calendar was introduced both to shift it back by omitting several days , and to reduce the number of leap years via the `` century rule '' to keep the equinoxes more or less fixed and the date of Easter consistently close to the vernal equinox . \n             Question: why there are 29 days in february in a leap year ? \n             Answer: ",

This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules , such as sugars , which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water -- hence the name photosynthesis , from the Greek \u03c6\u1ff6\u03c2 , ph\u014ds , `` light '' , and \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 , synthesis , `` putting together '' . In most cases , oxygen is also released as a waste product . Most plants , most algae , and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis ; such organisms are called photoautotrophs . Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth 's atmosphere , and supplies all of the organic compounds and most of the energy necessary for life on Earth . \n             Question: during photosynthesis carbon dioxide combines with water in the presence of sunlight to form ? \n             Answer: ",

During cell division these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of DNA replication , providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes . Eukaryotic organisms ( animals , plants , fungi and protists ) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus and some of their DNA in organelles , such as mitochondria or chloroplasts . In contrast prokaryotes ( bacteria and archaea ) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm . Within the eukaryotic chromosomes , chromatin proteins such as histones compact and organize DNA . These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins , helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed . \n             Question: the structure found in the cell that contains strands of dna is called a(n) ? \n             Answer: ",

As the temperature dropped , the equilibrium shifted in favour of protons due to their slightly lower mass , and the n / p ratio smoothly decreased . These reactions continued until the decreasing temperature and density caused the reactions to become too slow , which occurred at about T = 0.7 MeV ( time around 1 second ) and is called the freeze out temperature . At freeze out , the neutron - proton ratio was about 1 / 6 . However , free neutrons are unstable with a mean life of 880 sec ; some neutrons decayed in the next few minutes before fusing into any nucleus , so the ratio of total neutrons to protons after nucleosynthesis ends is about 1 / 7 . Almost all neutrons that fused instead of decaying ended up combined into helium - 4 , due to the fact that helium - 4 has the highest binding energy per nucleon among light elements . This predicts that about 8 % of all atoms should be helium - 4 , leading to a mass fraction of helium - 4 of about 25 % , which is in line with observations . Small traces of deuterium and helium - 3 remained as there was insufficient time and density for them to react and form helium - 4 . \n             Question: for heavy elements what is the ratio of neutrons to protons that predicts a stable nucleus ? \n             Answer: ",

McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927 . There she started her career as the leader in the development of maize cytogenetics , the focus of her research for the rest of her life . From the late 1920s , McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize . She developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas . One of those ideas was the notion of genetic recombination by crossing - over during meiosis -- a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information . She produced the first genetic map for maize , linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits . She demonstrated the role of the telomere and centromere , regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of genetic information . She was recognized among the best in the field , awarded prestigious fellowships , and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944 . \n             Question: who was awarded the nobel prize for the discovery that genes can change position on chromosomes ? \n             Answer: ",

Urine normally travels in one direction ( forward , or anterograde ) from the kidneys to the bladder via the ureters , with a 1 - way valve at the vesicoureteral ( ureteral - bladder ) junction preventing backflow . The valve is formed by oblique tunneling of the distal ureter through the wall of the bladder , creating a short length of ureter ( 1 -- 2 cm ) that can be compressed as the bladder fills . Reflux occurs if the ureter enters the bladder without sufficient tunneling , i.e. , too `` end - on '' . \n             Question: which disorder involves the retrograde passage of infected urine ? \n             Answer: ",

When brought to the surface , these nutrients are utilized by phytoplankton , along with dissolved CO ( carbon dioxide ) and light energy from the sun , to produce organic compounds , through the process of photosynthesis . Upwelling regions therefore result in very high levels of primary production ( the amount of carbon fixed by phytoplankton ) in comparison to other areas of the ocean . They account for about 50 % of global marine productivity . High primary production propagates up the food chain because phytoplankton are at the base of the oceanic food chain . \n             Question: zones of upwelling near the shores of land masses have high primary production because such zones ? \n             Answer: ",

An unremarkable group phase saw England win two and draw one of their games , with a 30 - yard strike by Bobby Charlton at Wembley in London against Mexico proving a highlight . All of England 's games were played at Wembley , which was ( and still is ) the England national team 's home stadium . An injury to centre forward Jimmy Greaves in the final group match against France prompted Ramsey into a re-think for the quarter final against Argentina , and inexperienced replacement Geoff Hurst responded by scoring the only goal of the game . Charlton then hit both goals in a 2 - 1 semi-final win over Portugal ( a game that was originally supposed to be played at Liverpool 's Goodison Park ) and England had reached the final , where they would meet West Germany . By now , Greaves was fit again , but Ramsey kept faith with Hurst , despite calls from the media for the main goalscorer to return . \n             Question: when did england last go to the world cup final ? \n             Answer: ",

The words are used to denote a connection resulting from the remarriage of a widowed parent and are related to the word \u00e1st\u00edeped meaning bereaved , with stepbairn and stepchild occasionally used simply as synonyms for orphan . Words such as stepbrother , stepniece and stepparent appeared much later and do not have any particular connotation of bereavement .

The interstellar medium consists of 10 to 10 particles per cm and is typically composed of roughly 70 % hydrogen by mass , with most of the remaining gas consisting of helium . This medium has been chemically enriched by trace amounts of heavier elements that were ejected from stars as they passed beyond the end of their main sequence lifetime . Higher density regions of the interstellar medium form clouds , or diffuse nebulae , where star formation takes place . In contrast to spirals , an elliptical galaxy loses the cold component of its interstellar medium within roughly a billion years , which hinders the galaxy from forming diffuse nebulae except through mergers with other galaxies . \n             Question: a glowing cloud of hot interstellar gas inside of which stars are being formed is called a(n) ? \n             Answer: ",
