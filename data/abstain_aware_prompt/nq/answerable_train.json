They contracted Saban Entertainment to help distribute the series to television , and Pioneer Entertainment to handle home video distribution . The Vancouver - based Ocean Studios were hired by Funimation to dub the anime ( Funimation had previously used the Ocean voice cast in their short - lived 1995 dub of Dragon Ball ) . Saban musicians Ron Wasserman and Jeremy Sweet , known for their work on the Power Rangers franchise , composed a new background score and theme song ( nicknamed `` Rock the Dragon '' ) . Funimation 's initial English dub of Dragon Ball Z had mandated cuts to content and length , which reduced the first 67 episodes into 53 . It premiered in the United States on September 13 , 1996 in first - run syndication , but halted production in 1998 after two seasons . This was due to Saban scaling down its syndication operations , in order to focus on producing original material for the Fox Kids block . Pioneer also ceased its home video release of the series at volume 17 ( the end of the dub ) and retained the rights to produce an uncut subtitled version , but did not do so . \n             Question: when was dragon ball z first aired in the us ? \n             Answer: ",

This included The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins in 1938 , as well as The King 's Stilts and The Seven Lady Godivas in 1939 , all of which were in prose , atypically for him .

The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands . The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states : sympathetic and parasympathetic . \n             Question: which of the following are components of the pns ? \n             Answer: ",

One historical term for the peninsula in France that largely corresponds to the modern French province is Lesser or Little Britain . That region was settled by many British immigrants during the period of Anglo - Saxon migration into Britain , and named `` Little Britain '' by them . The French term `` Bretagne '' now refers to the French `` Little Britain '' , not to the British `` Great Britain '' , which in French is called Grande - Bretagne . In classical times , the Graeco - Roman geographer Ptolemy in his Almagest also called the larger island megale Brettania ( great Britain ) . At that time , it was in contrast to the smaller island of Ireland , which he called mikra Brettania ( little Britain ) . In his later work Geography , Ptolemy refers to Great Britain as Albion and to Ireland as Iwernia . These `` new '' names were likely to have been the native names for the islands at the time . The earlier names , in contrast , were likely to have been coined before direct contact with local peoples was made . \n             Question: how do you say great britain in french ? \n             Answer: ",

Due to the lack of transportation alternatives from the manufacturing centers on the east coast , virtually all of their tools and machinery including rails , railroad switches , railroad turntables , freight and passenger cars , and steam locomotives were transported first by train to east coast ports .

He and Gugler devised a room architecturally grander than the previous two rooms , with more robust Georgian details : doors topped with substantial pediments , bookcases set into niches , a deep bracketed cornice , and a ceiling medallion of the Presidential Seal . Rather than a chandelier or ceiling fixture , the room is illuminated by light bulbs hidden within the cornice that `` wash '' the ceiling in light . In small ways , hints of Art Moderne can be seen , in the sconces flanking the windows and the representation of the eagle in the ceiling medallion . FDR and Gugler worked closely together , often over breakfast , with Gugler sketching the president 's ideas . One notion resulting from these sketches that has become fixed in the layout of the room 's furniture , is that of two high back chairs in front of the fireplace . The public sees this most often with the president seated on the left , and a visiting head of state on the right . This allowed FDR to be seated , with his guests at the same level , de-emphasizing his inability to stand .

Memory impairment due to alcohol has been linked to disruption of hippocampal function -- in particular affecting gamma - Aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) and N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) neurotransmission which negatively impacts long - term potentiation ( LTP ) . The molecular basis of LTP is associated with learning and memory . Particularly , damage to hippocampal CA1 cells adversely affects memory formation , and this disruption has been linked to dose - dependent levels of alcohol consumption . At higher doses , alcohol significantly inhibits neuronal activity in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers of the hippocampus . This impairs memory encoding since the hippocampus plays an important role in the formation of new memories . \n             Question: what part of the brain is memory affected by alcohol ? \n             Answer: ",

Because the Earth spins , Earth - bound observers need to account for the Coriolis force to correctly analyze the motion of objects . The Earth completes one rotation per day , so for motions of everyday objects the Coriolis force is usually quite small compared to other forces ; its effects generally become noticeable only for motions occurring over large distances and long periods of time , such as large - scale movement of air in the atmosphere or water in the ocean . Such motions are constrained by the surface of the Earth , so only the horizontal component of the Coriolis force is generally important . This force causes moving objects on the surface of the Earth to be deflected to the right ( with respect to the direction of travel ) in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere . The horizontal deflection effect is greater near the poles , since the effective rotation rate about a local vertical axis is largest there , and decreases to zero at the equator . Rather than flowing directly from areas of high pressure to low pressure , as they would in a non-rotating system , winds and currents tend to flow to the right of this direction north of the equator and to the left of this direction south of it . This effect is responsible for the rotation of large cyclones ( see Coriolis effects in meteorology ) . \n             Question: coriolosis component of acceleration can be found in ? \n             Answer: ",

The Canadian Shield is the largest exposure of this craton . From the Late Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic eras , North America was joined with the other modern - day continents as part of the supercontinent Pangaea , with Eurasia to its east . One of the results of the formation of Pangaea was the Appalachian Mountains , which formed some 480 million years ago , making it among the oldest mountain ranges in the world . When Pangaea began to rift around 200 million years ago , North America became part of Laurasia , before it separated from Eurasia as its own continent during the mid-Cretaceous period . The Rockies and other western mountain ranges began forming around this time from a period of mountain building called the Laramide orogeny , between 80 and 55 million years ago . The formation of the Isthmus of Panama that connected the continent to South America arguably occurred approximately 12 to 15 million years ago , and the Great Lakes ( as well as many other northern freshwater lakes and rivers ) were carved by receding glaciers about 10,000 years ago . \n             Question: when did north america arrive at the location it is in today ? \n             Answer: ",

He founded New France by planting a cross on the shore of the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula . The French subsequently tried to establish several colonies throughout North America that failed , due to weather , disease , or conflict with other European powers . Cartier attempted to create the first permanent European settlement in North America at Cap - Rouge ( Quebec City ) in 1541 with 400 settlers but the settlement was abandoned the next year after bad weather and attacks from Native Americans in the area . A small group of French troops were left on Parris Island , South Carolina in 1562 to build Charlesfort , but left after a year when they were not resupplied by France . Fort Caroline established in present - day Jacksonville , Florida , in 1564 , lasted only a year before being destroyed by the Spanish from St. Augustine . An attempt to settle convicts on Sable Island off Nova Scotia in 1598 failed after a short time . In 1599 , a sixteen - person trading post was established in Tadoussac ( in present - day Quebec ) , of which only five men survived the first winter . In 1604 Pierre Du Gua de Monts and Samuel de Champlain founded a short - lived French colony , the first in Acadia , on Saint Croix Island , presently part of the state of Maine , which was much plagued by illness , perhaps scurvy . The following year the settlement was moved to Port Royal , located in present - day Nova Scotia . \n             Question: who founded the first french colony in north america ? \n             Answer: ",

However , the best - known version of dualism is due to Ren\u00e9 Descartes ( 1641 ) , and holds that the mind is a non-extended , non-physical substance , a `` res cogitans '' . Descartes was the first to clearly identify the mind with consciousness and self - awareness , and to distinguish this from the brain , which was the seat of intelligence . He was therefore the first to formulate the mind -- body problem in the form in which it still exists today . \n             Question: who spread the theory that one is a product of the mind and body ? \n             Answer: ",

Diarist Thomas Raikes later recounted that `` No event ever produced so great a sensation in English society as the introduction of the waltz in 1813 '' . In the same year , a sardonic tribute to the dance by Lord Byron was anonymously published ( written the previous autumn ) . Influential dance master and author of instruction manuals , Thomas Wilson published A Description of the Correct Method of Waltzing in 1816 . Almack 's , the most exclusive club in London , permitted the waltz though the entry in the Oxford English Dictionary shows that it was considered `` riotous and indecent '' as late as 1825 . Ann Bronte in ' The Tenant of Wildfell Hall ' has a scene set in 1827 where the local vicar Reverend Milward tolerates quadrilles and country dances but intervenes decisively when a waltz is called for , declaring `` No , no , I do n't allow that !

Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity , famous for his humour , satire , and keen observation of character and society . His novels , most published in monthly or weekly instalments , pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction , which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication . Cliffhanger endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense . The instalment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience 's reaction , and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback . For example , when his wife 's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities , Dickens improved the character with positive features . His plots were carefully constructed , and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives . Masses of the illiterate poor chipped in ha'pennies to have each new monthly episode read to them , opening up and inspiring a new class of readers . \n             Question: what was the first book that charles dickens published ? \n             Answer: ",

Nodes of Ranvier are uninsulated and highly enriched in ion channels , allowing them to participate in the exchange of ions required to regenerate the action potential . Nerve conduction in myelinated axons is referred to as saltatory conduction ( from the Latin saltare `` to hop or to leap '' ) due to the manner in which the action potential seems to `` jump '' from one node to the next along the axon . This results in faster conduction of the action potential . \n             Question: what is the significance of the nodes of ranvier ? \n             Answer: ",
