The NES restarted the video game industry after the video game crash of 1983 , and was an international success . In 1989 , Nintendo released the Game Boy , which became the first handheld console to sell in large numbers . In the early 1990s , Nintendo 's market lead began to decrease ; although the 1990 Super Nintendo Entertainment System ( SNES ) was a strong seller , the Mega Drive / Genesis was a very strong contender . Nintendo and Sega would both lose a significant portion of the console market towards the end of the 1990s , as Sony Computer Entertainment 's PlayStation became the most popular console , beating the Nintendo 64 , though Nintendo managed to sell more than Sega Saturn . \n             Question: what was the first video game console made by nintendo ? \n             Answer: ",

It resulted in an Allied victory against the German armies in the west . The battle was the culmination of the German advance into France and pursuit of the Allied armies which followed the Battle of the Frontiers in August and had reached the eastern outskirts of Paris . A counter-attack by six French armies and the British Expeditionary Force ( BEF ) along the Marne River forced the Imperial German Army to retreat north - west , leading to the First Battle of the Aisne and the Race to the Sea .

Such meters are often calibrated to read some other quantity that can be converted to a current of that magnitude . The use of current dividers , often called shunts , allows a meter to be calibrated to measure larger currents . A meter can be calibrated as a DC voltmeter if the resistance of the coil is known by calculating the voltage required to generate a full scale current . A meter can be configured to read other voltages by putting it in a voltage divider circuit . This is generally done by placing a resistor in series with the meter coil . A meter can be used to read resistance by placing it in series with a known voltage ( a battery ) and an adjustable resistor . In a preparatory step , the circuit is completed and the resistor adjusted to produce full scale deflection . When an unknown resistor is placed in series in the circuit the current will be less than full scale and an appropriately calibrated scale can display the value of the previously unknown resistor . \n             Question: when is a galvanometer said to be sensitive ? \n             Answer: ",

In 1984 , Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act , which required states to raise their ages for purchase and public possession to 21 by October 1986 or lose 10 % of their federal highway funds . By mid-1988 , all 50 states and the District of Columbia had raised their purchase ages to 21 ( but not Puerto Rico , Guam , or the Virgin Islands , see Additional Notes below ) . South Dakota and Wyoming were the final two states to comply with the age 21 mandate . The current drinking age of 21 remains a point of contention among many Americans , because of it being higher than the age of majority ( 18 in most states ) and higher than the drinking ages of most other countries . The National Minimum Drinking Age Act is also seen as a congressional sidestep of the tenth amendment .

These structures are involved in detecting the five elements of taste perception : salty , sour , bitter , sweet and umami ; through the combination of these elements we detect `` flavors . '' A popular myth assigns these different tastes to different regions of the tongue ; in reality these tastes can be detected by any area of the tongue . Via small openings in the tongue epithelium , called taste pores , parts of the food dissolved in saliva come into contact with the taste receptors . These are located on top of the taste receptor cells that constitute the taste buds . The taste receptor cells send information detected by clusters of various receptors and ion channels to the gustatory areas of the brain via the seventh , ninth and tenth cranial nerves . \n             Question: where are taste buds located in your mouth ? \n             Answer: ",

MLB does not have a hard salary cap , instead employing a luxury tax which applies to teams whose total payroll exceeds certain set thresholds for a given season . Free agency did not exist in MLB prior to the end of the reserve clause in the 1970s , allowing owners before that time to wholly dictate the terms of player negotiations and resulting in significantly lower salaries . Babe Ruth , widely regarded as one of the greatest baseball players ever , earned an estimated $910,696 ( $14,654,832 inflation - adjusted from 1931 dollars ) over his entire playing career . When asked whether he thought he deserved to earn $80,000 a year ( $1,171,952 inflation - adjusted ) , while the president , Herbert Hoover , had a $75,000 salary , Ruth famously remarked , `` What the hell has Hoover got to do with it ?

They lack a cell nucleus and most organelles , in order to accommodate maximum space for hemoglobin ; they can be viewed as sacks of hemoglobin , with a plasma membrane as the sack . Approximately 2.4 million new erythrocytes are produced per second in human adults . The cells develop in the bone marrow and circulate for about 100 -- 120 days in the body before their components are recycled by macrophages . Each circulation takes about 60 seconds ( one minute ) . Approximately a quarter of the cells in the human body are red blood cells . Nearly half of the blood 's volume ( 40 % to 45 % ) is red blood cells . \n             Question: where does red blood cell formation occur in adults ? \n             Answer: ",

It resulted in the United States federal government pulling the last troops out of the South , and formally ended the Reconstruction Era . Through the Compromise , Republican Rutherford B. Hayes was awarded the White House over Democrat Samuel J. Tilden on the understanding that Hayes would remove the federal troops whose support was essential for the survival of Republican state governments in South Carolina , Florida and Louisiana . The compromise involved Democrats who controlled the House of Representatives allowing the decision of the Electoral Commission to take effect . The outgoing president , Republican Ulysses S. Grant , removed the soldiers from Florida . As president , Hayes removed the remaining troops from South Carolina and Louisiana . As soon as the troops left , many white Republicans also left , and the `` Redeemer '' Democrats took control . They already dominated most other state governments in the South .

From the outset of the story , the contentious nature of the couple 's conversation indicates resentment and unease . Some critics have written that the dialogue is a distillation of the contrasts between stereotypical male and female relationship roles : in the excerpt above , for instance , the woman draws the comparison with white elephants , but the hyper - rational male immediately denies it , dissolving the bit of poetry into objective realism with `` I 've never seen one . '' By saying , `` No , you would n't have '' she implies he had n't had a child before , or had n't allowed birth in the past . She also asks his permission to order a drink . Throughout the story , the woman is distant ; the American is rational . There may be more serious problems with the relationship than the purely circumstantial .

Its origin is attributed to English author Horace Walpole , with his 1764 novel The Castle of Otranto , subtitled ( in its second edition ) `` A Gothic Story '' . The effect of Gothic fiction feeds on a pleasing sort of terror , an extension of Romantic literary pleasures that were relatively new at the time of Walpole 's novel . It originated in England in the second half of the 18th century where , following Walpole , it was further developed by Clara Reeve , Ann Radcliffe , William Thomas Beckford and Matthew Lewis . The genre had much success in the 19th century , as witnessed in prose by Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein and the works of Edgar Allan Poe as well as Charles Dickens with his novella , A Christmas Carol , and in poetry in the work of Samuel Taylor Coleridge , Lord Byron and Poe . Another well known novel in this genre , dating from the late Victorian era , is Bram Stoker 's Dracula . The name Gothic refers to the ( pseudo ) - medieval buildings , emulating Gothic architecture , in which many of these stories take place . This extreme form of romanticism was very popular in England and Germany . The English Gothic novel also led to new novel types such as the German Schauerroman and the French Georgia . \n             Question: during what time in history were gothic stories popular ? \n             Answer: ",

The net effect is an inward force at its surface that causes the liquid to behave as if its surface were covered with a stretched elastic membrane . Thus , the surface becomes under tension from the imbalanced forces , which is probably where the term `` surface tension '' came from . Because of the relatively high attraction of water molecules for each other through a web of hydrogen bonds , water has a higher surface tension ( 72.8 millinewtons per meter at 20 \u00b0 C ) compared to that of most other liquids . Surface tension is an important factor in the phenomenon of capillarity . \n             Question: what is the high surface tension of water due to ? \n             Answer: ",

Trinitarians view these as elements of the codified doctrine . Ignatius of Antioch provides early support for the Trinity around 110 , exhorting obedience to `` Christ , and to the Father , and to the Spirit '' . Justin Martyr ( AD 100 -- c. 165 ) also writes , `` in the name of God , the Father and Lord of the universe , and of our Saviour Jesus Christ , and of the Holy Spirit '' . The first of the early church fathers to be recorded using the word `` Trinity '' was Theophilus of Antioch writing in the late 2nd century . He defines the Trinity as God , His Word ( Logos ) and His Wisdom ( Sophia ) in the context of a discussion of the first three days of creation . The first defence of the doctrine of the Trinity was in the early 3rd century by the early church father Tertullian . He explicitly defined the Trinity as Father , Son , and Holy Spirit and defended the Trinitarian theology against the `` Praxean '' heresy . St. Justin and Clement of Alexandra used the Trinity in their doxologies and St. Basil likewise , in the evening lighting of lamps . \n             Question: who first held that the trinity is defined as one substance in three persons ? \n             Answer: ",

The ten provinces are Alberta , British Columbia , Manitoba , New Brunswick , Newfoundland and Labrador , Nova Scotia , Ontario , Prince Edward Island , Quebec , and Saskatchewan . Several of the provinces were former British colonies , and Quebec was originally a French colony , while others were added as Canada grew .

Thereafter , in 1940 , the American acoustical physicist Floyd Firestone devised the first ultrasonic echo imaging device , the Supersonic Reflectoscope , to detect internal flaws in metal castings . In 1941 , the Austrian neurologist Karl Theo Dussik was in collaboration with his brother , Friedreich , a physicist , likely , the first person to ultrasonically echo image the human body , outlining thereby the ventricles of a human brain . Ultrasonic energy was first applied to the human body for medical purposes by Dr George Ludwig at the Naval Medical Research Institute , Bethesda , Maryland in the late 1940s . English - born physicist John Wild ( 1914 -- 2009 ) first used ultrasound to assess the thickness of bowel tissue as early as 1949 ; he has been described as the `` father of medical ultrasound '' . Subsequent advances in the field took place concurrently in several countries .

Its abbreviation is FG % . Although three - point field goal percentage is often calculated separately , three - point field goals are included in the general field goal percentage . Instead of using scales of 0 to 100 % , the scale . 000 to 1.000 is commonly used . A higher field goal percentage denotes higher efficiency . In basketball , a FG % of . 500 ( 50 % ) or above is considered a good percentage , although this criterion does not apply equally to all positions . Guards usually have lower FG % than forwards and centers . Field goal percentage does not completely tell the skill of a player , but a low field goal percentage can indicate a poor offensive player or a player who takes many difficult shots . In the NBA , Center Shaquille O'Neal has a high career FG % ( around . 580 ) because he plays near the basket making many high percentage layups and slam dunks . Guard Allen Iverson often had a low FG % ( around . 420 ) because he took the bulk of his team 's shot attempts , even with high difficulty shots . \n             Question: what is a good basketball field goal percentage ? \n             Answer: ",

Drugs must pass or permeate through these cells in order to be absorbed into the circulatory system . One particular cellular barrier that may prevent absorption of a given drug is the cell membrane . Cell membranes are essentially lipid bilayers which form a semipermeable membrane . Pure lipid bilayers are generally permeable only to small , uncharged solutes . Hence , whether or not a molecule is ionized will affect its absorption , since ionic molecules are charged . Solubility favors charged species , and permeability favors neutral species . Some molecules have special exchange proteins and channels to facilitate movement from the lumen into the circulation . \n             Question: where does the majority of drug absorption occur ? \n             Answer: ",

On July 16 , 1862 , Congress passed legislation authorizing the U.S. federal government to purchase land for national cemeteries for military dead , and put the U.S. Army Quartermaster General in charge of this program . In May 1864 , Union forces suffered large numbers of dead in the Battle of the Wilderness . Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs ordered that an examination of eligible sites be made for the establishment for a large new national military cemetery . Within weeks , his staff reported that Arlington Estate was the most suitable property in the area . The property was high and free from floods ( which might unearth graves ) , it had a view of the District of Columbia , and it was aesthetically pleasing . It was also the home of the leader of the armed forces of the Confederate States of America , and denying Robert E. Lee use of his home after the war was a valuable political consideration . The first military burial at Arlington , for William Henry Christman , was made on May 13 , 1864 , close to what is now the northeast gate in Section 27 . However , Meigs did not formally authorize establishment of burials until June 15 , 1864 . Arlington did not desegregate its burial practices until President Harry S.

When measuring all the photons emitted , the Sun is actually emitting more photons in the green portion of the spectrum than any other . When the Sun is low in the sky , atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow , red , orange , or magenta . Despite its typical whiteness , most people mentally picture the Sun as yellow ; the reasons for this are the subject of debate . The Sun is a G2V star , with G2 indicating its surface temperature of approximately 5,778 K ( 5,505 \u00b0 C , 9,941 \u00b0 F ) , and V that it , like most stars , is a main - sequence star .

The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands . The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states : sympathetic and parasympathetic . \n             Question: where is the pns located in the body ? \n             Answer: ",

When factor analysis ( a statistical technique ) is applied to personality survey data , some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person . For example , someone described as conscientious is more likely to be described as `` always prepared '' rather than `` messy '' . This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments . This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche . The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE . Beneath each proposed global factor , there are a number of correlated and more specific primary factors . For example , extraversion is said to include such related qualities as gregariousness , assertiveness , excitement seeking , warmth , activity , and positive emotions . \n             Question: what is the big five trait of conscientiousness ? \n             Answer: ",

However , according to Commodore John Leech of the International Hydrographic Organization ( IHO ) , this situation has no scientific sense since it has different ecosystem and life from the three oceans mentioned before and is located on a southern portion of Earth , hence the name of an ocean . This remains the current official policy of the IHO , since a 2000 revision of its definitions including the Southern Ocean as the waters south of the 60th parallel has not yet been adopted .

In short the theory is an explanation of the mechanism for the generation of diversity of antibody specificity .

The responsibility to assess scientific relevance has shifted from highly trained expert witnesses to judges deficient in science education .

The major challenges in realising fusion power are to engineer a system that can confine the plasma long enough at high enough temperature and density , for a long term reaction to occur , and for the most common reactions , managing neutrons that are released during the reaction , which over time can degrade many common materials used within the reaction chamber . \n             Question: what is the primary fuel that would be used in fusion reactors ? \n             Answer: ",

( At most tables the dealer also hits on a `` soft '' 17 , i.e. a hand containing an ace and one or more other cards totaling six . ) Players win by not busting and having a total higher than the dealer , or not busting and having the dealer bust , or getting a blackjack without the dealer getting a blackjack . If the player and dealer have the same total ( not counting blackjacks ) , this is called a `` push '' , and the player typically does not win or lose money on that hand .

The prefixes `` cis '' and `` trans '' are from Latin . In the context of chemistry , cis indicates that the functional groups are on the same side of the carbon chain while trans conveys that functional groups are on opposing sides of the carbon chain . Cis - trans isomers are stereoisomers , that is , pairs of molecules which have the same formula but whose functional groups are rotated into a different orientation in three - dimensional space . It is not to be confused with E -- Z isomerism , which is an absolute stereochemical description , and only to be used with alkenes . In general , stereoisomers contain double bonds that can not rotate , or they may contain ring structures , where the rotation of bonds is restricted or prevented . Cis and trans isomers occur both in organic molecules and in inorganic coordination complexes . Cis and trans descriptors are not used for cases of conformational isomerism where the two geometric forms easily interconvert , such as most open - chain single - bonded structures ; instead , the terms `` syn '' and `` anti '' would be used . \n             Question: what do you mean by cis and trans isomerism ? \n             Answer: ",

In contrast , he never gave a description of any vision in which he saw an angel separately confer the Melchizedek priesthood . However , by the turn of the 20th century , Latter Day Saint theologians believed that such a separate ordination by angels had occurred prior to the organization of the Church of Christ on April 6 , 1830 . This was largely because the early church organization contained the office of elder , which at least by 1835 was considered an office of the Melchizedek priesthood . As evidence for such a pre-organization angellic conferral , writers referred to a revelation in which Smith said he heard `` The voice of Peter , James , and John in the wilderness between Harmony , Susquehanna county , and Colesville , Broome county , on the Susquehanna river , declaring themselves as possessing the keys of the kingdom , and of the dispensation of the fulness of times !

Most of the ATP produced by aerobic cellular respiration is made by oxidative phosphorylation . This works by the energy released in the consumption of pyruvate being used to create a chemiosmotic potential by pumping protons across a membrane . This potential is then used to drive ATP synthase and produce ATP from ADP and a phosphate group . Biology textbooks often state that 38 ATP molecules can be made per oxidised glucose molecule during cellular respiration ( 2 from glycolysis , 2 from the Krebs cycle , and about 34 from the electron transport system ) . However , this maximum yield is never quite reached because of losses due to leaky membranes as well as the cost of moving pyruvate and ADP into the mitochondrial matrix , and current estimates range around 29 to 30 ATP per glucose . \n             Question: how many atp molecules are produced during the electron transport chain ? \n             Answer: ",

The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls , accompanied by a wide area ( later known as the `` death strip '' ) that contained anti-vehicle trenches , `` fakir beds '' and other defenses . The Eastern Bloc portrayed the Wall as protecting its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the `` will of the people '' in building a socialist state in East Germany .

Under sustained campaigning against sati by Christian missionaries such as William Carey and Brahmin Hindu reformers such as Ram Mohan Roy , the provincial government banned sati in 1829 . This was followed up by similar laws by the authorities in the princely states of India in the ensuing decades , with a general ban for the whole of India issued by Queen Victoria in 1861 . In Nepal , sati was banned in 1920 . The Indian Sati Prevention Act from 1988 further criminalised any type of aiding , abetting , and glorifying of sati . \n             Question: who had spearheaded the movement against the tradition of sati ? \n             Answer: ",

The purpose of the urinary system is to eliminate waste from the body , regulate blood volume and blood pressure , control levels of electrolytes and metabolites , and regulate blood pH . The urinary tract is the body 's drainage system for the eventual removal of urine . The kidneys have an extensive blood supply via the renal arteries which leave the kidneys via the renal vein . Each kidney consists of functional units called nephrons . Following filtration of blood and further processing , wastes ( in the form of urine ) exit the kidney via the ureters , tubes made of smooth muscle fibres that propel urine towards the urinary bladder , where it is stored and subsequently expelled from the body by urination ( voiding ) . The female and male urinary system are very similar , differing only in the length of the urethra . \n             Question: list the main functions of the urinary system ? \n             Answer: ",
