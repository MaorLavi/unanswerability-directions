In the second book , Rowling reveals that I am Lord Voldemort is an anagram of the character 's birth name , Tom Marvolo Riddle . According to the author , Voldemort 's name is an invented word . Some literary analysts have considered possible meanings in the name : Philip Nel believes that Voldemort is derived from the French for `` flight of death '' , and in a 2002 paper , Nilsen and Nilsen suggest that readers get a `` creepy feeling '' from the name Voldemort , because of the French word `` mort '' ( `` death '' ) within it and that word 's association with cognate English words derived from the Latin mors . \n             Question: harry potter the name that cannot be said ? \n             Answer: ",

'' The idea that many children in Indigenous American Communities are closely involved in community endeavors , both spatially and relationally , which help to promote nonverbal communication , given that words are not always necessary . When children are closely related to the context of the endeavor as active participants , coordination is based on a shared reference , which helps to allow , maintain , and promote nonverbal communication . The idea of `` context - embeddedness '' allows nonverbal communication to be a means of learning within Native American Alaskan Athabaskans and Cherokee communities . By observing various family and community social interactions , social engagement is dominated through nonverbal communication . For example , when children elicit thoughts or words verbally to their elders , they are expected to structure their speech carefully . This demonstrates cultural humility and respect as excessive acts of speech when conversational genre shifts reveal weakness and disrespect . This careful self - censorship exemplifies traditional social interaction of Athapaskin and Cherokee Native Americans who are mostly dependent on nonverbal communication . \n             Question: a key communicative component of native american interaction is proxemics ? \n             Answer: ",

Anno would go on to produce live - action films . Many scenes in Evangelion were so controversial that it forced TV Tokyo to clamp down with censorship of violence and sexuality in anime .

As her unsupported stern rose out of the water , exposing the propellers , the ship began to break in two between the third and fourth funnels , due to the immense forces on the keel . With the bow underwater , and air trapped in the stern , the stern remained afloat and buoyant for a few minutes longer , rising to a nearly vertical angle with hundreds of people still clinging to it , before sinking . For many years it was generally believed the ship sank in one piece ; however , when the wreck was located many years later , it was discovered that the ship had fully broken in two . All remaining passengers and crew were immersed into lethally cold water with a temperature of 28 \u00b0 F ( \u2212 2 \u00b0 C ) . Almost all of those in the water died of cardiac arrest or other bodily reactions to freezing water , within 15 -- 30 minutes .

'' The Warriors continued giving Chamberlain the ball . Warrior Al Attles later explained , `` We wanted that Wilt got the record , because we all liked him .

Indeed , a major source of failure of US environmental protection legislation was the civil character of federal enforcement actions . Their chief sanction was fines , which many corporations took in stride as a cost of doing business . Environmental criminal law covers narrower ground . Its core consists of the criminal provisions of eight federal statutes passed mainly in the 1970s and amended in the last two decades . \n             Question: environmental crimes involve violations of the criminal law that damage protected land areas ? \n             Answer: ",

The first national color broadcast ( the 1954 Tournament of Roses Parade ) occurred on January 1 , 1954 , but over the next dozen years most network broadcasts , and nearly all local programming , continued to be in black - and - white . In 1956 NBC 's The Perry Como Show became the first live network television series to present a majority of episodes in color . CBS 's The Big Record , starring pop vocalist Patti Page , was the first television show broadcast in color for the entire 1957 - 1958 season ; its production costs were greater than most movies were at the time not only because of all the stars featured on the hour - long extravaganza but the extremely high - intensity lighting and electronics required for the new RCA TK - 41 cameras . It was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers , due in part to the color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime - time programming would be broadcast in color that autumn .

This results in muscle atrophy , a loss of strength and , ultimately , a depletion of muscular tissue completely . Muscle weakness is not necessarily a symptom of catabolysis : the muscles will normally feel fatigued when they are not receiving enough energy or oxygen . Ultimately , catabolysis can progress to the point of no return when the body 's machinery for protein synthesis , itself made of protein , has been degraded to the point that it can not handle any protein . At this point , attempts to correct the disorder by giving food or protein are futile . \n             Question: what happens when your body breaks down muscle ? \n             Answer: ",

Area code 807 , covering northwestern Ontario , was split from area code 705 in early 1962 . Although 705 was not close to exhaustion at the time , creating a new area code was thought necessary in order to improve routing of calls from Manitoba and western Canada to northwestern Ontario . Greater routing efficiency has since been achieved with the implementation of highly computerized digital exchanges that were not available in the early 1960s . \n             Question: where is area code 705 in ontario canada ? \n             Answer: ",

Twenty - four pitchers have reached this milestone . The New York Gothams / Giants / San Francisco Giants are the only franchise to see three players reach the milestone while on their roster : those players are Mickey Welch , Christy Mathewson , and Randy Johnson . Early in the history of professional baseball , many of the rules favored the pitcher over the batter ; the distance pitchers threw to home plate was shorter than today , and pitchers were able to use foreign substances to alter the direction of the ball . The first player to win 300 games was Pud Galvin in 1888 . Seven pitchers recorded all or the majority of their career wins in the 19th century : Galvin , Cy Young , Kid Nichols , Tim Keefe , John Clarkson , Charley Radbourn , and Mickey Welch . Four more pitchers joined the club in the first quarter of the 20th century : Christy Mathewson , Walter Johnson , Eddie Plank , and Grover Cleveland Alexander . Young is the all - time leader in wins with 511 , a mark that is considered unbreakable .

The synthesis of proteins from RNA is known as translation . In eukaryotes , translation occurs in the cytoplasm , where the ribosomes are located . Ribosomes are made of a small and large subunit that surround the mRNA . In translation , messenger RNA ( mRNA ) is decoded to produce a specific polypeptide according to the rules specified by the trinucleotide genetic code . This uses an mRNA sequence as a template to guide the synthesis of a chain of amino acids that form a protein . Translation proceeds in four phases : activation , initiation , elongation , and termination ( all describing the growth of the amino acid chain , or polypeptide that is the product of translation ) . \n             Question: where do the amino acids come from in protein synthesis ? \n             Answer: ",

This gave corporations an opportunity to appeal to a wide variety of potential customers . Due to this , variety marketing had to be changed in order to persuade a wide audience with different needs into buying the same thing . It has developed over the years into a worldwide multi-billion dollar industry . Although sagging in the Great Depression it regained popularity and continued to expand through the 40s and 50s . It slowed during the anti-capitalist movements of the 60 's and 70 's before coming back stronger than before in the 80 's , 90 's and today . These trends are due to corresponding upswings in mass media , the parent of mass marketing . For most of the twentieth century , major consumer - products companies held fast to mass marketing - mass - producing , mass distributing and mass promoting about the same product in about the same way to all consumers . Mass marketing creates the largest potential market , which leads to lowered costs .

Galvanized steel , such as the casing of a lamp post or road divider , exhibits a non-uniformly colored patchwork of interlocking polygons of different shades of grey or silver . Each polygon is a single crystal of zinc adhering to the surface of the steel beneath . Zinc and lead are two common metals which form large crystals ( grains ) visible to the naked eye . The atoms in each grain are organized into one of seven 3d stacking arrangements or crystal lattices ( cubic , tetrahedral , hexagonal , monoclinic , triclinic , rhombohedral and orthorhombic ) . The direction of alignment of the matrices differ between adjacent crystals , leading to variance in the reflectivity of each presented face of the interlocked grains on the galvanized surface . The average grain size can be controlled by processing conditions and composition , and most alloys consist of much smaller grains not visible to the naked eye . This is to increase the strength of the material ( see Hall - Petch Strengthening ) . \n             Question: the crystal structure of a material is generally examined by ? \n             Answer: ",

Lipid - soluble hormones target specific sequences of DNA by diffusing into the cell . When they have diffused into the cell , they bind to receptors ( intracellular ) , and migrate into the nucleus . heir response elements are DNA sequences ( promoters ) that are bound by the complex of the steroid bound to its receptor . The receptors themselves are zinc - finger proteins . These receptors include those for glucocorticoids ( glucocorticoid receptors ) , estrogens ( estrogen receptors ) , androgens ( androgen receptors ) , thyroid hormone ( T3 ) ( thyroid hormone receptors ) , calcitriol ( the active form of vitamin D ) ( calcitriol receptors ) , and the retinoids ( vitamin A ) ( retinoid receptors ) . Receptor - protein interactions induce the uptake and destruction of their respective hormones in order to regulate their concentration in the body .

Their biological availability to the body depends upon dihydrofolate reductase action in the liver . This action is unusually slow in humans , being less than 2 % of that in rats ( and with an almost - 5-fold variation in enzymatic activity ) , leading to the accumulation of unmetabolized folic acid .

After the German invasion of Poland in 1939 , there initially were different local decrees forcing Jews to wear distinct signs ( e.g. in the General Government , a white armband with a blue Star of David ; in the Warthegau , a yellow badge , in the form of a Star of David , on the left breast and on the back ) . If a Jew was found in public without the star , he could be severely punished . The requirement to wear the Star of David with the word Jude ( German for Jew ) was then extended to all Jews over the age of six in the Reich and in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia ( by a decree issued on September 1 , 1941 and signed by Reinhard Heydrich ) and was gradually introduced in other Nazi - occupied areas . Others , however , wore the Star of David as a symbol of defiance against Nazi antisemitism , as in the case of United States Army private Hal Baumgarten , who wore a Star of David emblazoned on his back during the 1944 invasion of Normandy . \n             Question: when did israel adopt the star of david ? \n             Answer: ",

This misunderstanding of the term immaculate conception is frequently met in the mass media . Catholics believe that Mary was conceived of both parents traditionally known by the names of Saint Joachim and Saint Anne . In 1677 , the Holy See condemned the error of Imperiali who taught that St. Anne in the conception and birth of Mary remained virgin which had been a belief surfacing occasionally since the 4th century . The Church celebrates the Feast of the Immaculate Conception ( when Mary was conceived free from original sin ) on 8 December , exactly nine months before celebrating the Nativity of Mary . The feast of the Annunciation ( which commemorates the virginal conception and the Incarnation of Jesus ) is celebrated on 25 March , nine months before Christmas Day . \n             Question: what is the distinction between the virgin birth and the immaculate conception ? \n             Answer: ",

These enzymatic cycles were found to play a key role in stimulating energy dissipation within light - harvesting antenna proteins by non-photochemical quenching - a mechanism to reduce the amount of energy that reaches the photosynthetic reaction centers . Non-photochemical quenching is one of the main ways of protecting against photoinhibition . In higher plants , there are three carotenoid pigments that are active in the xanthophyll cycle : violaxanthin , antheraxanthin , and zeaxanthin . During light stress , violaxanthin is converted to zeaxanthin via the intermediate antheraxanthin , which plays a direct photoprotective role acting as a lipid - protective anti-oxidant and by stimulating non-photochemical quenching within light - harvesting proteins . This conversion of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin is done by the enzyme violaxanthin de-epoxidase , while the reverse reaction is performed by zeaxanthin epoxidase . \n             Question: where is xanthophyll found in a plant's cell ? \n             Answer: ",

Like the Shiva trilogy , Scion of Ikshvaku will have philosophy as one of its themes , drawing from Tripathi 's understanding of Indian scriptures . The author worked over a year on the series but he did not have to research about the subject , since being born into a religious family ( Tripathi 's father was a pandit ) he was aware of the stories about Rama ; he took further inspirations from Valmiki 's Ramayana , the Ramcharitmanas , Kamba Ramayanam as well as the Adbhuta Ramayana . \n             Question: how many books are there in ram chandra series ? \n             Answer: ",

This was especially true for gold certificates from 1865 to 1934 . However , for the most part , the introduction of an electronic money system has made large - scale cash transactions obsolete . When combined with concerns about counterfeiting and the use of cash in unlawful activities such as the illegal drug trade and money laundering , it is unlikely that the U.S. government will re-issue large denomination currency in the near future , despite the amount of inflation that has occurred since 1969 ( a $500 bill is now worth less , in real terms , than a $100 bill was worth in 1969 ) . According to the U.S. Department of Treasury website , `` The present denominations of our currency in production are $1 , $2 , $5 , $10 , $20 , $50 and $100 . The purpose of the United States currency system is to serve the needs of the public and these denominations meet that goal .

Critics noted the song 's soulful sound and its departure from the usual mainstream pop sound of Clarkson 's previous releases . NPR 's Karen Gwee noted that the song makes a familiar emphasis on percussion over melody but was surprised that its chorus was chanted rather than belted -- a surprising move for Clarkson . Hugh McIntyre of Forbes described the trap verses as `` odd '' on its own , but is complimentary harmonized `` when the horns kick in and bring the soul the song needed '' . Idolator 's Mike Wass compared the song as from the ' 90s , but is also quintessentially 2017 , describing it as falling closer to the Back to Basics - era Christina Aguilera in its blend of old and new . \n             Question: who wrote love so soft by kelly clarkson ? \n             Answer: ",

There may be an unrifled throat ahead of the chamber so a cartridge may be chambered without pushing the bullet into the rifling . This reduces the force required to load a cartridge into the chamber , and prevents leaving a bullet stuck in the rifling when an unfired cartridge is removed from the chamber . The specified diameter of the throat may be somewhat greater than groove diameter , and may be enlarged by use if hot powder gas melts the interior barrel surface when the rifle is fired . Freebore is a groove - diameter length of smoothbore barrel without lands forward of the throat . Freebore allows the bullet to transition from static friction to sliding friction and gain linear momentum prior to encountering the resistance of increasing rotational momentum . Freebore may allow more effective use of propellants by reducing the initial pressure peak during the minimum volume phase of internal ballistics before the bullet starts moving down the barrel . Barrels with freebore length exceeding the rifled length have been known by a variety of trade names including paradox . \n             Question: why is rifling present in the bore of the barrel ? \n             Answer: ",

What the king required was to have the consent , the resolution of the three estates of the realm ; it was in reality of little importance to him whether their resolutions expressed themselves in common or separately . At the Estates General of 1484 the elections were made in common for the three orders , and the deputies also arrived at their resolutions in common . But after 1560 the rule was that each order deliberate separately ; the royal declaration of 23 June 1789 ( at the outbreak of the French Revolution ) even stated that they formed three distinct chambers . But Necker 's report to the conseil du roi according to which the convocation of 1789 was decided , said ( as did the declaration of 23 June ) , that on matters of common interest the deputies of the three orders could deliberate together , if each of the others decided by a separate vote in favour of this , and if the king consented . \n             Question: what was the composition of the estate general of france ? \n             Answer: ",

The field of pop music developed tremendously during this period , as the increasingly low price of recorded music stimulated demand and greater profits for the record industry . As a result , music marketing became more and more prominent , resulting in a number of mainstream pop stars whose popularity was previously unheard of . Many of the first such stars were Italian - American crooners like Dean Martin , Rudy Vallee , Tony Bennett , Perry Como , Frankie Laine and , most famously , the `` first pop vocalist to engender hysteria among his fans '' Frank Sinatra . The era of the modern teen pop star , however , began in the 1960s . Bubblegum pop groups like The Monkees were chosen entirely for their appearance and ability to sell records , with no regard to musical ability . The same period , however , also saw the rise of new forms of pop music that achieved a more permanent presence in the field of American popular music , including rock , soul and pop - folk . By the end of the 1960s , two developments had completely changed popular music : the birth of a counterculture , which explicitly opposed mainstream music , often in tandem with political and social activism , and the shift from professional composers to performers who were both singers and songwriters . \n             Question: how did american popular culture change around the turn of the 20th century ? \n             Answer: ",

Research has shown that the market value of customers of the failed banks is adversely affected at the date of the failure announcements . It is often feared that the spill over effects of a failure of one bank can quickly spread throughout the economy and possibly result in the failure of other banks , whether or not those banks were solvent at the time as the marginal depositors try to take out cash deposits from these banks to avoid from suffering losses . Thereby , the spill over effect of bank panic or systemic risk has a multiplier effect on all banks and financial institutions leading to a greater effect of bank failure in the economy . As a result , banking institutions are typically subjected to rigorous regulation , and bank failures are of major public policy concern in countries across the world . \n             Question: the insolvency of a bank can spread and cause a financial crisis due to ? \n             Answer: ",
