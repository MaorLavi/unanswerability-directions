This full triple structure is seen in the similar discussions at Mark 9 : 43 - 47 , and a version much closer to that in Mark appears at Matthew 18 : 8 - 9 . Jesus here uses two thirds of the structure , the first reference to the eye is clearly linked to his previous statement that looking at a woman lustfully is sinful , but it is uncertain why he continues to the hand when he specifically stated that action and touching is not required for sin . Hill feels that this might be related to theft . At the time the law saw adultery as a form of theft , as it was taking another man 's wife . The right hand , the more active of the two among most of the population , had long been metaphorically associated with theft . An alternate view , that has been adopted by some in recent years , is that the mention of a hand linked to lust is a reference to masturbation . In the New Testament this is the verse most often cited to condemn that practice . A third view is to see this verse connected less to the previous verses , and more as part of the discussion of divorce that takes up the next two verses . This argument states that the cutting off of the sinful hand is a metaphor for separation from a sinful spouse , even if it causes great pain . \n             Question: bible verse if your hand causes you sin cut off ? \n             Answer: ",

Dynasties of Satavahana , Chola , Chera , Chalukya , Pallava , Rashtrakuta , Kakatiya and Hoysala were at their peak during various periods of history .

When the European powers arrived during the 16th century CE , the southern kingdoms resisted the new threats , and many parts eventually succumbed to British occupation . The British created the Madras Presidency which covered most of south India directly administered by the British Raj , and divided the rest into a number of dependent princely states .

People came to these places for nationalistic pride , work , administration , education and social services . The exception is South Africa who , with its strict influx control regime and apartheid policy , to a certain degree managed to control urban growth .

In the 1886 decision on Wabash , St. Louis & Pacific Railway Company v.

The efficiency of an algorithm may depend dramatically on the characteristics of the given functions . For example , many algorithms use the derivative of the input function , while others work on every continuous function . In general , numerical algorithms are not guaranteed to find all the roots of a function , so failing to find a root does not prove that there is no root . However , for polynomials , there are specific algorithms that use algebraic properties for locating the roots in intervals ( or disks for complex roots ) that are small enough to ensure the convergence of numerical methods ( typically Newton 's method ) to the unique root so located . \n             Question: numerical methods for finding the roots of a function ? \n             Answer: ",

The translation of lilies is traditional , but far from certain . Modern scholars have proposed a number of different flowers that Jesus could be here referring to , according to Fowler these include the autumn crocus , scarlet poppy , Turk 's cap lily , Anemone coronaria , the narcissus , the gladiolus , and the iris . France notes that flowers were less specifically defined in that era , and lily could be a word referring to any showy variety . The verse could also just mean flowers in general , rather than a specific variety . `` In the field '' implies that these are the wildflowers growing in the fields , rather than the cultivated ones growing in gardens . Harrington notes that some have read this verse as originally referring to beasts rather than flowers . \n             Question: who was compared unfavorably to the lilies of the field ? \n             Answer: ",

Utah went into the 4th quarter up 17 points , but the BYU offense brought it within 3 . With less than 30 seconds remaining , BYU quarterback Riley Nelson successfully drove into Utah territory on 4th and long with a 40 - yard pass to wide receiver , Cody Hoffman . On what was thought to be the final play of the game , Nelson 's deflected pass fell incomplete as time seemingly expired and the Utah fans rushed the field . The pass , however , was shown to hit the ground with one second left , giving BYU an opportunity to kick a field goal from 51 yards ( once the fans had been cleared from the field of play ) . On the attempt , the kick was blocked , the ball recovered by BYU , and the runner subsequently tackled . However , Utah fans again rushed the field , this time before the play was over , thus earning a penalty that gave BYU another chance at a field goal , this one from only 36 yards . That attempt was unsuccessful , however , when the kick hit the left upright and went awry , leading Utah fans to rush the field for a third and final time .

They were primarily used to demoralize , injure , and kill entrenched defenders , against whom the indiscriminate and generally very slow - moving or static nature of gas clouds would be most effective . The types of weapons employed ranged from disabling chemicals , such as tear gas , to lethal agents like phosgene , chlorine , and mustard gas . This chemical warfare was a major component of the first global war and first total war of the 20th century . The killing capacity of gas was limited , with about ninety thousand fatalities from a total of some 1.3 million casualties caused by gas attacks . Gas was unlike most other weapons of the period because it was possible to develop countermeasures , such as gas masks . In the later stages of the war , as the use of gas increased , its overall effectiveness diminished . The widespread use of these agents of chemical warfare , and wartime advances in the composition of high explosives , gave rise to an occasionally expressed view of World War I as `` the chemist 's war '' and also the era where `` weapons of mass destruction '' were created . \n             Question: world war 1 gas warfare tactics and equipment ? \n             Answer: ",

IPsec was a mandatory part of all IPv6 protocol implementations , and Internet Key Exchange was recommended . But with RFC 6434 the inclusion of IPsec in IPv6 implementations was downgraded to a recommendation because it was considered impractical to require full IPsec implementation for all types of devices that may use IPv6 . However , as of RFC 4301 IPv6 protocol implementations that do implement IPsec need to implement IKEv2 and need to support a minimum set of cryptographic algorithms . This requirement will help to make IPsec implementations more interoperable between devices from different vendors .

In 1824 , there were six states in which electors were legislatively appointed , rather than popularly elected , so it is uncertain what the national popular vote would have been if all presidential electors had been popularly elected . When no candidate received a majority of electoral votes in 1824 , the election was decided by the House of Representatives and so could be considered distinct from the latter four elections in which all of the states had popular selection of electors . The true national popular vote was also uncertain in the 1960 election , and the plurality for the winner depends on how votes for Alabama electors are allocated . \n             Question: where and when do electoral college electors vote ? \n             Answer: ",

The expression `` French fried potatoes '' first occurred in print in English in the 1856 work Cookery for Maids of All Work by E. Warren : `` French Fried Potatoes . -- Cut new potatoes in thin slices , put them in boiling fat , and a little salt ; fry both sides of a light golden brown colour ; drain . '' It is apparent that this account refers to thin , shallow - fried slices of potato -- it is not clear where or when the now familiar deep - fried batons or fingers of potato were first prepared . In the early 20th century , the term `` French fried '' was being used in the sense of `` deep - fried '' for foods like onion rings or chicken . It is unlikely that `` French fried '' refers to frenching in the sense of julienning , which is not attested until after French fried potatoes . Previously , frenching referred only to trimming meat off the shanks of chops . \n             Question: what did the french fry say to the potato ? \n             Answer: ",

In contrast , eclogitic diamonds contain organic carbon from organic detritus that has been pushed down from the surface of the Earth 's crust through subduction ( see plate tectonics ) before transforming into diamond . These two different source of carbon have measurably different C : C ratios .
