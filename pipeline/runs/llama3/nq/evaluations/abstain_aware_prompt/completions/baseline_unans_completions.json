Three possibilities are known as Novopangaea , Amasia , and Pangaea Ultima .

As atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing altitude , the air has expanded and adiabatically cooled to the point that the air reaches its adiabatic dew point ( which is not the same as its constant pressure dew point commonly reported in weather forecasts ) . At the adiabatic dew point , moisture condenses onto the mountain and it precipitates on the top and windward sides of the mountain . The air descends on the leeward side , but due to the precipitation it has lost much of its moisture . Typically , descending air also gets warmer because of adiabatic compression ( see Foehn winds ) down the leeward side of the mountain , which increases the amount of moisture that it can absorb and creates an arid region . \n             Question: what effect do the atlas mountains have on rainfall ? \n             Answer: ",

First , it was during the sitting of the first Rump Parliament that members of the House of Commons became known as `` MPs '' ( Members of Parliament ) . Second , Cromwell gave a huge degree of freedom to his parliaments , although royalists were barred from sitting in all but a handful of cases . His vision of parliament appears to have been largely based on the example of the Elizabethan parliaments . However , he underestimated the extent to which Elizabeth I and her ministers had directly and indirectly influenced the decision - making process of her parliaments . He was thus always surprised when they became troublesome . He ended up dissolving each parliament that he convened . Yet it is worth noting that the structure of the second session of the Second Protectorate Parliament of 1658 was almost identical to the parliamentary structure consolidated in the Glorious Revolution Settlement of 1689 . \n             Question: when was the first parliament opened and who was the first speaker ? \n             Answer: ",

To some degree , these frequency bands are a matter of nomenclature ( i.e. , any rhythmic activity between 8 -- 12 Hz can be described as `` alpha '' ) , but these designations arose because rhythmic activity within a certain frequency range was noted to have a certain distribution over the scalp or a certain biological significance . Frequency bands are usually extracted using spectral methods ( for instance Welch ) as implemented for instance in freely available EEG software such as EEGLAB or the Neurophysiological Biomarker Toolbox . Computational processing of the EEG is often named quantitative electroencephalography ( qEEG ) . \n             Question: 4 types of brain wave classifications as recognized by an eeg machine ? \n             Answer: ",

In other vertebrates -- amphibians , reptiles and birds , the meninges include a thick outer dura mater and a thick inner secondary meninx . In the early 1900s , Giuseppe Sterzi an Italian anatomist carried out comparative studies on the meninges from the lancelet to man . Contrary to previous reports the spinal meninges were seen to be very simple , both in the adult lower vertebrates and in the early developmental stages of the more advanced vertebrates . From the mesenchyme surrounding the neural tube only a single leaflet forms the primitive meninx . In the following phylogenetic and ontogenetic stages , the latter divides into an internal leaflet : the secondary meninx , and into an external one : the dura mater . Finally , in higher vertebrates , even the secondary meninx divides into the arachnoid and the pia . In the same animals , Sterzi demonstrated that , while in the spinal medulla the dura keeps its identity , in the skull it fuses with the periosteum . He also demonstrated the continuity of all meninges with the envelopes of nerves and with the filum terminale . \n             Question: what are the 3 layers of the meninges ? \n             Answer: ",

The commission reviewed ancient and modern forms of execution including lethal injection but finally settled on electrocution in 1888 .

However , due to safety concerns regarding anti-suffocation protection in the event of a source gas failure ( i.e. the oxygen cylinder being drained completely ) , one of the two one - way valves is normally removed , allowing inhalation of outside air to a significant degree . However , as almost all non-rebreathing masks are disposable , and manufactured in 1 adult size , most ( from decades of clinical observation ) do not provide a good seal with an individual patient 's face , thus permitting the inflow of large amounts of ambient air ( air follows the path of least resistance ) , and diluting the oxygen provided . Hence , very few patients receive anything close to 100 % oxygen . Very high flows ( > = 30 LPM ) from the oxygen flowmeter are required to partially overcome room air dilution . Further , the larger the patient 's inspiratory flow rate , the greater the dilution from air . Very little effort is required by most patients , to inspire at flow rates in excess of 50 LPM ( easily seen in the pulmonary function lab with routine spirometric testing ) . \n             Question: when should a non rebreather mask be used ? \n             Answer: ",
