While India 's Independence Day celebrates its freedom from British Rule , the Republic Day celebrates the coming into force of its constitution .

As atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing altitude , the air has expanded and adiabatically cooled to the point that the air reaches its adiabatic dew point ( which is not the same as its constant pressure dew point commonly reported in weather forecasts ) . At the adiabatic dew point , moisture condenses onto the mountain and it precipitates on the top and windward sides of the mountain . The air descends on the leeward side , but due to the precipitation it has lost much of its moisture . Typically , descending air also gets warmer because of adiabatic compression ( see Foehn winds ) down the leeward side of the mountain , which increases the amount of moisture that it can absorb and creates an arid region . \n             Question: what effect do the atlas mountains have on rainfall ? \n             Answer: ",

First , it was during the sitting of the first Rump Parliament that members of the House of Commons became known as `` MPs '' ( Members of Parliament ) . Second , Cromwell gave a huge degree of freedom to his parliaments , although royalists were barred from sitting in all but a handful of cases . His vision of parliament appears to have been largely based on the example of the Elizabethan parliaments . However , he underestimated the extent to which Elizabeth I and her ministers had directly and indirectly influenced the decision - making process of her parliaments . He was thus always surprised when they became troublesome . He ended up dissolving each parliament that he convened . Yet it is worth noting that the structure of the second session of the Second Protectorate Parliament of 1658 was almost identical to the parliamentary structure consolidated in the Glorious Revolution Settlement of 1689 . \n             Question: when was the first parliament opened and who was the first speaker ? \n             Answer: ",

At neutral pH , the dye absorbs red light most strongly and transmits blue light . Solutions of the dye , therefore , are blue . At low pH , the dye absorbs ultraviolet and blue light most strongly and appears yellow in solution . In solution at pH 3.6 ( in the middle of the transition range of this pH indicator ) obtained by dissolution in water without any pH adjustment , bromophenol blue has a characteristic green red color , where the apparent color shifts depending on the concentration and / or path length through which the solution is observed . This phenomenon is called dichromatic color . Bromophenol blue is the substance with the highest known value of Kreft 's dichromaticity index . This means it has the largest change in color hue , when the thickness or concentration of observed sample increases or decreases . \n             Question: what is the purpose of the bromophenol blue dye in the samples ? \n             Answer: ",
        "response": "unanswerable.\n\nThe passage describes the properties and color changes of bromophenol blue, but it doesn't state a purpose for its use in samples. It's presented as a dye and pH indicator, but not *why* someone would use it."

This is done by exposing dark - adapted retina to a certain wavelength of light that paralyzes the particular type of cone sensitive to that wavelength for up to thirty minutes from being able to dark - adapt making it appear white in contrast to the grey dark - adapted cones when a picture of the retina is taken . The results illustrate that S cones are randomly placed and appear much less frequently than the M and L cones . The ratio of M and L cones varies greatly among different people with regular vision ( e.g. values of 75.8 % L with 20.0 % M versus 50.6 % L with 44.2 % M in two male subjects ) . \n             Question: where are the cones in the eye located ? \n             Answer: ",

The electrical depolarizations that trigger cardiac myocytes to contract arise spontaneously within the myocyte itself . The heartbeat is initiated in the pacemaker regions and spreads to the rest of the heart through a conduction pathway . Pacemaker cells develop in the primitive atrium and the sinus venosus to form the sinoatrial node and the atrioventricular node respectively . Conductive cells develop the bundle of His and carry the depolarization into the lower heart . Cardiac activity is visible beginning at approximately 5 weeks of pregnancy . \n             Question: when does the heart develop and begin pumping blood ? \n             Answer: ",

Other states adopted their own systems of numbering , and by 1926 all states but Maryland had signed the Atlantic Highway as various routes , usually changing numbers at the state line . In 1925 , the Joint Board on Interstate Highways created a preliminary list of interstate routes to be marked by the states , including Route 1 along the Atlantic . This highway began at Fort Kent , Maine and followed the existing Route 24 to Houlton and Route 15 to Bangor , beyond which it generally followed the Atlantic Highway to Miami . In all states but Georgia that had numbered their state highways , Route 1 followed only one or two numbers across the state .

In other vertebrates -- amphibians , reptiles and birds , the meninges include a thick outer dura mater and a thick inner secondary meninx . In the early 1900s , Giuseppe Sterzi an Italian anatomist carried out comparative studies on the meninges from the lancelet to man . Contrary to previous reports the spinal meninges were seen to be very simple , both in the adult lower vertebrates and in the early developmental stages of the more advanced vertebrates . From the mesenchyme surrounding the neural tube only a single leaflet forms the primitive meninx . In the following phylogenetic and ontogenetic stages , the latter divides into an internal leaflet : the secondary meninx , and into an external one : the dura mater . Finally , in higher vertebrates , even the secondary meninx divides into the arachnoid and the pia . In the same animals , Sterzi demonstrated that , while in the spinal medulla the dura keeps its identity , in the skull it fuses with the periosteum . He also demonstrated the continuity of all meninges with the envelopes of nerves and with the filum terminale . \n             Question: what are the 3 layers of the meninges ? \n             Answer: ",

The first is on board bill of lading , also known as clean bill of lading . Clean bill of lading is used when there is no discrepancy between description filled by shipper and the actual goods shipped on board . Clean bill of lading indicates that the goods have been properly loaded on board the carrier 's ship according to the prima facie evidence .

It is valid as long as in the hand of the carrier , but once it is transferred and negotiated to the third party , it can not be rebutted and the carrier can no longer mark discrepancy . The second is claused bill of lading . Claused bill of lading is used when there is some discrepancy between description in the bill of lading and the actual goods . For claused bill of lading , one can mark only when the goods are loaded . \n             Question: difference between straight and order bill of lading ? \n             Answer: ",

However , due to safety concerns regarding anti-suffocation protection in the event of a source gas failure ( i.e. the oxygen cylinder being drained completely ) , one of the two one - way valves is normally removed , allowing inhalation of outside air to a significant degree . However , as almost all non-rebreathing masks are disposable , and manufactured in 1 adult size , most ( from decades of clinical observation ) do not provide a good seal with an individual patient 's face , thus permitting the inflow of large amounts of ambient air ( air follows the path of least resistance ) , and diluting the oxygen provided . Hence , very few patients receive anything close to 100 % oxygen . Very high flows ( > = 30 LPM ) from the oxygen flowmeter are required to partially overcome room air dilution . Further , the larger the patient 's inspiratory flow rate , the greater the dilution from air . Very little effort is required by most patients , to inspire at flow rates in excess of 50 LPM ( easily seen in the pulmonary function lab with routine spirometric testing ) . \n             Question: when should a non rebreather mask be used ? \n             Answer: ",

The poem has been dated to between the 8th and the early 11th centuries , with some recent scholarship offering what has been called `` a cohesive and compelling case for Beowulf 's early composition . '' However , opinion differs as to whether the composition of the poem is nearly contemporary with its transcription , whether it was first written in the 8th century , or if a proto - version of the poem was perhaps composed at an even earlier time ( possibly as one of the Bear 's Son Tales ) and orally transmitted for many years , then transcribed in its present form at a later date . Albert Lord felt strongly that the manuscript represents the transcription of a performance , though likely taken at more than one sitting . J.R.R. Tolkien believed that the poem retains too genuine a memory of Anglo - Saxon paganism to have been composed more than a few generations after the completion of the Christianisation of England around AD 700 , and Tolkien 's conviction that the poem dates to the 8th century has been defended by Tom Shippey , Leonard Neidorf , Rafael J.

It was a peaceful century , with no wars between the great powers , apart from the 1854 -- 1871 interval , and some small wars between Russia and the Ottoman Empire . After 1900 there were a series of wars in the Balkan region , which exploded out of control into World War I ( 1914 -- 18 ) -- a massively devastating event that was unexpected in its timing , duration , casualties , and long - term impact . \n             Question: what was the general goal of imperial powers such as great britain in the late nineteenth century ? \n             Answer: ",
